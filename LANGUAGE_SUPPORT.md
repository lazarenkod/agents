# Multilingual Language Support

## Overview

All agents, commands, and skills in this marketplace now support automatic language detection and respond in the language of the user's input.

## Supported Languages

- **Russian** (Русский)
- **English** (English)
- **Mixed** (Mixed language input)

## How It Works

Each agent, command, and skill includes a **Language Support** section that specifies:

```
## Language Support

Detect the language of the user's input and respond in the same language:
- If input is in **Russian**, respond entirely in **Russian**
- If input is in **English**, respond in **English**
- For mixed language input, respond in the language of the primary content
- Maintain all technical terms, variable names, and code samples in their original form

This applies to all interactions: explanations, code generation, documentation, and technical guidance.
```

## Usage Examples

### Russian Input

```
Пользователь: Как настроить GitOps с помощью ArgoCD?

Ответ: Агент предоставит полный ответ на русском языке с примерами кода,
       объяснениями и пошаговыми инструкциями.
```

### English Input

```
User: How to set up GitOps with ArgoCD?

Response: The agent will provide complete guidance in English with code examples,
          explanations, and step-by-step instructions.
```

### Mixed Input

```
User: What is the difference between ArgoCD и Flux для GitOps?

Response: The agent detects that the primary content is in English and responds
          in English, maintaining Russian terms as provided.
```

## Technical Implementation

### Agent Support

All **163 agents** now include language detection instructions in their system prompts:
- Kubernetes Architect
- Backend Architect
- Frontend Developer
- Security Auditor
- Database Optimizer
- ... and 158 more

### Command Support

All **86 commands** support multilingual output:
- k8s-manifest-scaffold
- k8s-gitops-setup
- k8s-security-hardening
- performance-optimization
- ... and 82 more

### Skill Support

All **73 skills** provide multilingual guidance:
- gitops-workflow
- helm-chart-scaffolding
- k8s-manifest-generator
- k8s-security-policies
- ... and 69 more

## Maintenance Scripts

Three Python scripts are provided for maintaining and updating language support:

### 1. `add-language-support.py`

Updates all agent files with language support instructions.

```bash
python3 add-language-support.py
```

**Output:**
- Updates agents that don't have language support
- Skips agents that already have it
- Provides summary of changes

### 2. `add-language-support-commands.py`

Updates all command files with language support instructions.

```bash
python3 add-language-support-commands.py
```

### 3. `add-language-support-skills.py`

Updates all skill files with language support instructions.

```bash
python3 add-language-support-skills.py
```

## Guidelines for New Content

When creating new agents, commands, or skills, always include:

### For Agents
```markdown
## Language Support

Detect the language of the user's input and respond in the same language:
- If input is in **Russian**, respond entirely in **Russian**
- If input is in **English**, respond in **English**
- For mixed language input, respond in the language of the primary content
- Maintain all technical terms, variable names, and code samples in their original form

This applies to all interactions: explanations, code generation, documentation, and technical guidance.
```

### For Commands
```markdown
## Language Support

All outputs adapt to the input language:
- **Russian input** → **Russian response**
- **English input** → **English response**
- **Mixed input** → Response in the language of the primary content
- **Technical terms, code, and system names** maintain their original form

This command works seamlessly in both languages.
```

### For Skills
```markdown
## Language Support

This skill documentation and all guidance adapt to user language:
- **Russian input** → **Russian explanations and examples**
- **English input** → **English explanations and examples**
- **Mixed input** → Language of the primary content
- **Code samples and technical terms** maintain their original names

When using this skill, specify your preferred language in your request.
```

## Current Statistics

| Type | Count | Language-Enabled | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Agents | 163 | 163 | 100% |
| Commands | 86 | 86 | 100% |
| Skills | 74 | 73 | 98.6% |
| **Total** | **323** | **322** | **99.7%** |

## Notes

- Technical terms, variable names, and code samples always maintain their original form in any language
- The language detection is based on the primary language of the user's input
- Code examples, API documentation, and technical references are provided in their standard form

## Support

If you encounter any issues with language support or want to add support for additional languages, please:

1. Check if the component (agent/command/skill) has the Language Support section
2. Run the appropriate maintenance script to update missing components
3. Test with both Russian and English input to verify proper language detection
