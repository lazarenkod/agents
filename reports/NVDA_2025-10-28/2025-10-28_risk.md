## Position Sizing Recommendations

### By Risk Tolerance

| Profile | Max Position | Risk/Return | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** | 3-5% | -2.5% to -5% portfolio impact | DCA, tight stops |
| **Moderate** | 5-8% | -5% to -8% portfolio impact | Core holding, partial trim |
| **Aggressive** | 8-12% | -8% to -12% portfolio impact | Concentrated bet, VOL tolerance |

**Warning:** Do NOT exceed 12% under any circumstances (index overlap risk)

### Risk Management Rules

1. **Set Stop-Loss Immediately**
   - Conservative: -20% ($145)
   - Moderate: -25% ($135)
   - Aggressive: -30% ($126)

2. **Reduce if Position Grows >12%**
   - Due to price appreciation
   - Trim to 10% to maintain discipline

3. **Earnings Volatility Management**
   - Reduce position 2-3 days before earnings if >8%
   - Re-establish after volatility settles

## Systemic Risks

### Semiconductor Cycle Risk (HIGH)

**Current Phase:** Late expansion (multi-year AI boom)

**Downside Scenarios:**
- Inventory glut: -30% to -50% revenue decline
- Pricing pressure: Gross margin compression 20-30 pts
- Stock impact: -60% to -75% (cyclical multiple compression)

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Late in cycle, warning signs emerging

### Geopolitical Risk (VERY HIGH)

**US-China Decoupling:**
- Current: $5.5B Q1 revenue loss
- Future: Complete AI chip export ban possible
- Impact: -15% to -20% total revenue

**Taiwan Conflict:**
- Risk: TSMC production shutdown = existential threat
- Probability: 2-3%
- Impact: Stock → $0 in extreme scenario

**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH - Multiple active threats

### AI Bubble Risk (VERY HIGH)

**Bubble Evidence:**
- Circular financing (NVIDIA investing in customers)
- Valuation multiples 59% above sector
- $500B+ capex with unclear ROI
- Historic parallels (Cisco, IoT)

**Burst Scenarios:**
- Multiple compression: 47.9x → 15-20x
- Growth reversal: +50% → -10% to -20%
- Stock impact: -70% to -85%

**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH - Multiple indicators present

## Concentration Risk

### Single-Stock Concentration

| Position Size | Portfolio Impact | Risk Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **5%** | -2.5% at -50% decline | LOW |
| **10%** | -5% at -50% decline | MODERATE |
| **15%** | -7.5% at -50% decline | HIGH |
| **20%+** | -10%+ at -50% decline | EXTREME/RECKLESS |

**Recommendation:** Maximum 8-10% for aggressive investors (including index overlap)

### Index Overlap Problem

**NVDA is 8% of S&P 500** (highest single-stock weight since 1981)

**Example:** $100K portfolio
- 60% S&P 500 fund = $4.8K indirect NVDA
- 10% direct NVDA = $10K
- **Total = $14.8K (14.8%) - TOO HIGH**

**Solution:** Account for indirect exposure when sizing direct position

---

## Concentration Risk Mitigation

### Recommended Approach

**Step 1: Calculate Total NVDA Exposure**
- Direct holdings + (Index fund allocation × 8%)
- Target: <12% total

**Step 2: Set Position Limits**
- Conservative: 3-5% direct
- Moderate: 5-8% direct
- Aggressive: 8-10% direct (accounting for index)

**Step 3: Implement Stops & Rebalancing**
- Trailing stop: 15-20%
- Rebalance quarterly
- Trim if >12% due to appreciation

### Advanced Hedging (Optional)

**For concentrated positions >10%:**
- Protective puts: Buy 6-12 month puts (5-10% premium)
- Collars: Sell calls, buy puts (zero-cost hedges)
- Put spreads: Cheaper protection, limited coverage

**Example Collar:**
- Own 100 shares at $180
- Sell $220 call (cap gains at +22%)
- Buy $160 put (protect below -11%)
- **Net cost:** $0-2 (nearly free protection)

---

## Exit Criteria

### Hard Stops (Immediate Exit)

- Gross margin <55% for 2 consecutive quarters
- Market share <70% (competitive erosion)
- Complete China export ban
- Antitrust breakup ordered
- TSMC Taiwan shutdown (geopolitical crisis)

### Soft Stops (Gradual Exit)

- Position >15% due to appreciation → trim to 10%
- Earnings miss 2 consecutive quarters → reduce 50%
- Hyperscaler capex cuts >20% YoY → trim 25%
- Margin sustained decline <70% → reassess thesis

### Profit-Taking Targets

- +50% gain: Sell 25% (harvest partial gains)
- +100% gain: Sell 50% (lock in double)
- +150%+ gain: Continue trimming as position grows
- Valuation >60x P/E with slowing growth: Reduce to 5%
