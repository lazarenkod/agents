## Conclusion

NVIDIA maintains a **STRONG competitive position** with a **9/10 moat** anchored by the CUDA ecosystem. The company's dominance is nearly complete at present with 90%+ market share. However, the competitive landscape is intensifying as:

1. Hyperscalers develop custom chips (45% market share by 2028)
2. AMD closes technical and software gaps
3. Open source alternatives mature
4. New entrants target niche segments

Despite these threats, NVIDIA's ecosystem moat and technology leadership should sustain market leadership through at least 2028. Long-term (2030+), erosion to 60-70% share is likely, but the company should remain the dominant player.

**Patent portfolio is world-class** with the highest citation impact in AI chips. Intellectual property provides both defensive and offensive leverage in competitive battles and patent litigation.

**Competitive moat is exceptional** but eroding from extraordinary baseline. Investment thesis depends on NVIDIA maintaining technology leadership and ecosystem dominance through 2027-2028. Beyond that, TAM growth becomes critical to offsetting share erosion.
