### Organizational Structures

**Common Structures**:

**Functional Organization** (by function):
```
CEO
├── VP Engineering
├── VP Product
├── VP Marketing
└── VP Sales
```
Best for: Small companies, clear functional expertise
Challenges: Silos, slow cross-functional decisions

**Product/Market Organization** (by product or market):
```
CEO
├── SVP Product A
│   ├── Engineering
│   ├── Product
│   └── Marketing
└── SVP Product B
    ├── Engineering
    ├── Product
    └── Marketing
```
Best for: Multiple products/markets, autonomy needed
Challenges: Duplication, harder to scale shared functions

**Matrix Organization** (hybrid):
```
CEO
├── VP Engineering (shared across products)
├── VP Product (shared across products)
└── Product Leaders
    ├── Lead for Product A
    └── Lead for Product B
```
Best for: Balance between specialization and focus
Challenges: Complexity, potential for unclear priorities

**Choosing Your Structure**:
1. What's the primary way we create value?

### Defining Culture & Values

**Company Culture**:

Culture is "how we do things around here" - the shared values, behaviors, and ways of working.

**Defining Your Culture**:

**Step 1: Identify Core Values**:
- What do we fundamentally believe?
- How do we want to treat people?
- What behaviors do we expect?
- What are we NOT?

**Example Values**:
- Transparency: We communicate openly and honestly
- Customer-obsessed: Customer success is our #1 priority
- Execution-focused: We ship and iterate fast
- Learning culture: We learn from failures and improve
- Diversity & inclusion: Different perspectives make us stronger

**Step 2: Define Behaviors**:
For each value, what does it look like in practice?
- Example: "Transparency" means:
  - Share information broadly, not hoarded
  - Admit mistakes and learn from them
  - Give direct feedback
  - Share both good and bad news

**Step 3: Live the Culture**:
- Hiring: Do candidates embody values?
- Performance management: Are we evaluating against values?
- Recognition: Celebrate people living values
- Consequences: Address violations of values
- Leadership modeling: Do leaders embody values?

**Step 4: Communicate & Reinforce**:
- Share stories that demonstrate culture
- Regular communication about values
- Rituals and traditions that reinforce culture
- New employee onboarding and indoctrination
- Regular culture reviews and evolution

### Communication & Transparency

**Leadership Communication**:

**Regular Cadence**:

- **Bi-weekly**: All-hands meeting (transparency, celebration, feedback)
- **Monthly**: Skip-level 1-on-1s (connect with people 2 levels below)
- **Quarterly**: Town halls (strategy, results, forward look)
- **Annual**: Offsite and strategy session

**What to Communicate**:
- **Progress**: How are we doing vs. goals?
- **Changes**: What's new or different?
- **Decisions**: What are we doing and why?
- **Celebration**: Wins and individual recognition
- **Challenges**: What we're struggling with
- **Strategy**: Where are we going?

**How to Communicate**:
- Be clear and direct (avoid jargon)
- Tell stories (engage emotion)
- Show data (ground in facts)
- Explain the why (help people understand)
- Invite questions (dialogue not monologue)
- Follow up consistently

### Compensation & Equity

**Compensation Strategy**:

**Base Salary**:
- Market competitive (50th-75th percentile for role)
- Fair across company (avoid huge disparities)
- Transparent or semi-transparent
- Adjusted based on role, experience, performance

**Variable Compensation** (bonus):
- Typically 10-30% of base for employees
- 30-100%+ of base for executives
- Tied to company and individual goals
- Performance-based (carrot and stick)

**Equity**:
- Early employees get more equity
- Longer vesting period (4 years typical)
- Cliff vesting (1 year) before any vesting
- Strike price at fair market value
- Equity re-negotiation during financing rounds

**Equity Guidelines** (as % of company):
- CEO: 10-15% at founding
