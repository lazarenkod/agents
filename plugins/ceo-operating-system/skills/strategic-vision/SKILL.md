## Core Concepts

### Strategic Vision Framework

**5-Year Vision** (The Destination):
- Where do we want to be in 5 years?
- What problem are we solving at scale?
- What's our market position and market size?
- What makes us defensible and different?

A good 5-year vision is:
- Inspiring and motivating
- Specific enough to guide decisions
- Ambitious but achievable
- Clear about target customer and problem solved

**Example Vision**:
"In 5 years, we'll be the #1 choice for enterprise customers managing distributed teams. We'll serve 10,000 companies with 1M daily active users. We'll be the platform that makes remote work as effective as in-person work."

### Strategic Pillars

Annual strategy should be built on 3-5 strategic pillars:

**Pillar 1: Product Excellence**
- What product investments do we need to make?
- What new capabilities unlock new customer segments?
- How do we stay ahead of competition?

**Pillar 2: Market Expansion**
- What new customer segments should we target?
- What geographies are we expanding into?
- How do we grow revenue per customer?

**Pillar 3: Operational Excellence**
- What operational capabilities do we need to scale?
- How do we improve margins and unit economics?
- What infrastructure investments are needed?

**Pillar 4: Team & Culture**
- What talent do we need to hire?
- How do we build leadership depth?
- What culture do we want to establish?

**Pillar 5: Capital Strategy** (if needed)
- What's our funding plan?
- How do we manage cash and runway?
- What's our path to profitability or IPO?

- What's the cost of the current solution?

**Solution**: Why are you the best choice?
- What's unique about your approach?
- What capabilities do you have?
- What's defensible about your position?

**Competitive Differentiation**: Why you vs. alternatives?

   - What are the implications of each?
   - What's the upside and downside?

4. **Analyze Scenarios**
   - What if we're right?
   - What if market conditions change?
   - What's the worst case?
   - What's the best case?

5. **Make the Decision**
   - Which path maximizes long-term value?
   - What's our conviction level?
   - How do we communicate it?

### Market & Competitive Analysis

**Market Sizing**:
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: How big is the overall market?

### Scenarios & Optionality

**Building strategic optionality**:

**Scenario Planning**:

**Strategic Options**:
- What bets can we make to be prepared for different futures?
