# Execution Excellence (EXO) Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting quarterly OKRs and priorities
- Designing quarterly planning processes
- Tracking progress against goals
- Making mid-quarter course corrections
- Building execution discipline and accountability
- Cascading goals across the organization
- Managing trade-offs and resource allocation
- Improving execution consistency

## Core Concepts

### The EXO Model (Entrepreneurial Operating System)

The EXO model provides a structured rhythm for quarterly execution:

**Core Elements**:
1. **Vision**: 5-year goal (from strategic vision)
2. **Annual Plan**: Where we're going this year
3. **Quarterly Goals**: What we'll accomplish this quarter
4. **Weekly Rhythm**: Accountability and adjustment
5. **Health Monitors**: Key metrics we track

### OKR Framework (Objectives & Key Results)

**OKRs** = Where we're going (Objective) + How we'll measure success (Key Results)

**Characteristics of Good OKRs**:
- **Ambitious**: Challenging enough to require focus and effort
- **Measurable**: Clear success criteria (60-70% achievement is target)
- **Time-bound**: Quarterly or annual
- **Aligned**: Connected to company and departmental strategy
- **Owned**: Clear owner and accountability

**Structure**:
- **Objective**: Qualitative, directional, motivating
  - Example: "Become the #1 choice for enterprise customers"
- **Key Results**: 2-4 quantified outcomes
  - KR1: Close 10 net new enterprise accounts (currently 2/quarter)
  - KR2: Achieve 95%+ customer retention (currently 90%)
  - KR3: NPS of 60+ (currently 40)

### Quarterly Planning Process

**Planning Timeline** (Typical):

**Week 1**: CEO and Leadership Team
- Review last quarter results
- Assess market and competitive changes
- Identify new priorities and changes
- Draft company-level OKRs

**Week 2**: Cross-functional Input
- Share draft OKRs with company
- Get departmental input and suggestions
- Identify dependencies and conflicts
- Refine company-level OKRs

**Week 3**: Departmental Planning
- Each department/team sets their OKRs
- Align with company goals
- Identify resource needs and conflicts
- Get buy-in from team members

**Week 4**: Goal Setting & Kick-off
- Finalize all OKRs
- Communicate to entire company
- Hold all-hands kick-off
- Begin execution

### Cascading Goals

**Goal Cascade Model**:

```
Company-Level OKRs (CEO owns)
    ↓
Department OKRs (VP owns, supports company goals)
    ↓
Team OKRs (Manager owns, supports department goals)
    ↓
Individual Goals (Individual owns, supports team goals)
```

**Important Principles**:
- Each level should have 3-5 goals (not more)
- Goals should cascade but not be identical
- There should be autonomy in HOW to achieve
- Goals should be interconnected but not completely dependent

### Execution Disciplines

**Weekly Rhythm**:
- **Weekly Team Meetings**: 30 min check-in on progress
- **Weekly Segue Reports**: Quick status on OKR progress
- **Issues Log**: What blockers/obstacles are we hitting?
- **To-Do List**: What's the priority for this week?

**Monthly Rhythm**:
- **Monthly Review**: More detailed look at progress
- **Board Update**: If monthly cadence with board
- **Resource Adjustments**: Any needed reallocation?
- **Communication**: All-hands update on progress

**Quarterly Rhythm**:
- **Quarterly Business Review (QBR)**: Deep dive on results
- **Retrospective**: What worked? What didn't?
- **Planning Session**: Next quarter goals and priorities
- **All-hands Celebration**: Celebrate wins and share learnings

### Key Metrics & Health Monitors

**Health Monitors** = The metrics you track to ensure company health:

**Financial Health**:
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Runway (months of cash remaining)
- Gross margin
- Cash burn rate

**Customer Health**:
- Net retention (expansion revenue)
- Net revenue retention (NRR)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)

**Product Health**:
- Activation rate (users who experience core value)
- Retention (% of users active in subsequent months)
- Engagement (frequency, depth of usage)
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)

**Team Health**:
- Employee satisfaction/engagement score
- Turnover rate (esp. key people)
- Time to hire
- Diversity metrics

**Track these on a Real-Time Dashboard**:
- Updated weekly or daily
- Visible to entire company
- Clear goals and status (on-track, at-risk, off-track)
- Leads to discussions and adjustments

### Making Trade-offs & Prioritization

**Prioritization Framework**:

When you have more opportunities than capacity:

1. **Impact Assessment**: What's the potential upside?
   - Revenue impact
   - Customer impact
   - Strategic impact

2. **Effort Assessment**: What's the cost?
   - Time required
   - Resources needed
   - Complexity

3. **Strategic Alignment**: Does it support our goals?
   - Does it advance our strategy?
   - Does it align with our vision?
   - Is it a distraction from core priorities?

4. **Dependency Analysis**: What are the dependencies?
   - Are other teams dependent on us?
   - Do we depend on others?
   - What's the critical path?

5. **Make the Trade-off Decision**:
   - Do it (add to quarterly plan)
   - Defer (next quarter or later)
   - Decline (not aligned with strategy)

### Common Execution Traps

**Trap 1: Too Many Goals**
- Problem: Diffuses effort and focus
- Solution: Ruthlessly prioritize to 3-5 key goals
- Guideline: You should be able to say your top 3 goals from memory

**Trap 2: Goals Without Accountability**
- Problem: No one owns the goal
- Solution: Assign one clear owner for each goal
- Check: Can you name the person accountable for each OKR?

**Trap 3: Optimistic Goal Setting**
- Problem: Goals are too easy, company is bored
- Solution: Aim for 60-70% achievement rate
- Check: Are we stretching ourselves?

**Trap 4: Cascading = Copying**
- Problem: Each level has identical goals
- Solution: Goals should cascade but with autonomy
- Check: Does each team have unique goals supporting company goals?

**Trap 5: No Feedback Loop**
- Problem: Set goals then forget until quarter ends
- Solution: Weekly check-ins and mid-quarter adjustments
- Check: Are you reviewing progress every week?

### Mid-Quarter Adjustments

**When to Adjust OKRs Mid-Quarter**:

**Good Reasons to Adjust**:
- Market changed dramatically (new competitor, economic downturn)
- Key customer opportunity emerged or was lost
- We learned something fundamental about the business
- Dependencies from other teams failed

**Bad Reasons to Adjust**:
- Execution is harder than expected
- Priorities feel overwhelming
- We want to add more goals

**Process for Adjustments**:
1. Make case for why adjustment is needed
2. Get consensus from leadership team
3. Communicate clearly what changed and why
4. Reset team expectations
5. Update health monitors and tracking

### Communication & Cadence

**Communicating OKRs Effectively**:

**The Why**:
- What's the business context?
- What are we betting on?
- Why does this matter?

**The What**:
- What are the specific OKRs?
- What's the success metric?
- Who owns it?

**The How**:
- What are the key initiatives?
- What resources are needed?
- What are the dependencies?

**Frequency**:
- **Weekly**: 15-minute team syncs on progress
- **Monthly**: 30-minute leadership team deep dive
- **Quarterly**: All-hands kickoff and retrospective
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalation and adjustment as needed
