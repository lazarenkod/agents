## Core Concepts

### 1. Product Vision & Strategy

**Vision Definition**
A compelling product vision articulates the future state and impact of the product. Great visions are:
- **Inspiring** - Motivate teams and stakeholders
- **Clear** - Understandable across all audiences
- **Measurable** - Tied to concrete business outcomes
- **Time-bound** - Specific time horizons for achievement
- **Differentiated** - Unique market positioning

**Vision Components:**
- **Mission** - Why the product exists, user problem being solved
- **Target Market** - Who we're serving, market segments, customer personas
- **Differentiation** - How we're different from competitors
- **Success Metrics** - Measurable goals and KPIs
- **Guiding Principles** - Values that guide product decisions

**Vision Framework Example:**
```
Vision: "Make financial planning accessible to every household"
Mission: Empower users to take control of their financial future
Target: Middle-income households (household income $50K-$150K)
Differentiation: AI-powered personalization + human financial advisor access
Metrics: 1M active users, 80% user retention, $50M ARR by Year 3
Principles: Transparency, security, accessibility, user education
```

### 2. Market Opportunity Sizing

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**
The entire revenue opportunity in a market assuming 100% market capture.

**Calculation Approaches:**
- **Top-down (Deductive)** - Start with large market, apply percentages for addressability
  - Global financial planning market: $400B
  - Addressable to software: 60% = $240B
  - TAM = $240B

- **Bottom-up (Inductive)** - Build from customer unit economics
  - Target customers: 100M US households
  - Average willingness to pay: $10/month = $120/year
  - TAM = 100M × $120 = $12B

**Market Sizing Matrix:**
| Market | Global Size | Addressable % | TAM |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Premium Services | $400B | 60% | $240B |
| Middle Market | $600B | 40% | $240B |
| Value Segment | $800B | 20% | $160B |
| **Total** | **$1.8T** | - | **$640B** |

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**
The portion of TAM you can realistically serve given constraints.
- Initial SAM focus: US middle-income households = $120B
- Geographic expansion: SAM grows to $200B (US + Canada + Australia)

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**
Revenue you can realistically capture in a defined period.
- Year 1 SOM: 0.5% market share = $600M potential
- Year 3 SOM: 2% market share = $2.4B potential

### 3. Competitive Positioning

```

### 4. Product Roadmap Planning

**Roadmap Frameworks**

**Theme-Based Roadmap**
Organize features by strategic theme:
- Q1: Core functionality (MVP)
- Q2: Expansion features (user retention)
- Q3: Monetization (premium features)
- Q4: Growth (distribution partnerships)

**Outcome-Based Roadmap**
Focus on desired business outcomes:
- Acquire 10K users (Q1)
- Achieve 60% retention (Q2)
- Launch monetization (Q3)
- Reach $100K MRR (Q4)

**Risk/Reward-Based Roadmap**
Balance innovation with risk:
- High Value/Low Risk: Authentication, core workflows
- High Value/High Risk: AI personalization, institution integrations
- Low Value/Low Risk: UI improvements, performance optimizations
- Low Value/High Risk: Advanced analytics, experimental features

**Phased Release Planning**

### 5. Feature Prioritization

**RICE Prioritization Framework**

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach = number of users affected (quarterly basis)
Impact = value per user (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low)
Confidence = certainty of estimates (1.0=high, 0.8=medium, 0.5=low)
Effort = person-months required (1-15 months)
```

**Example Scoring:**

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Mobile app | 5000 | 2 | 0.7 | 4 | 1,750 |
| AI recommendations | 4000 | 3 | 0.8 | 6 | 1,600 |
| Bank integrations | 3000 | 3 | 0.9 | 5 | 1,620 |
| Social features | 2000 | 1 | 0.6 | 3 | 400 |
| Performance optimization | 5000 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 2 | 1,125 |

**Decision Process:**
1. Score all features using RICE
2. Rank by score descending
3. Adjust for strategic alignment
4. Validate with stakeholder input
5. Allocate resources to top items

### 6. Success Metrics & OKRs
