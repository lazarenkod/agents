## Key Features

### 1. COO Executive Agent
- **Model**: Haiku (fast, cost-effective operational decisions)
- **Expertise**: Strategic operations, efficiency, execution, risk, metrics
- **Use**: Ask for operational guidance, improvement strategies, execution plans

### 2. Process Optimization Skill
**Problem**: Slow/broken processes, high costs, quality issues
**Solution**: 
- Map current state (Value Stream Mapping)
- Identify bottlenecks and waste
- Design improvements (DMAIC methodology)
- Implement with minimal disruption
- Measure improvement impact

**Expected Benefits**: 20-50% cycle time reduction, <1% error rate, 10-20% cost savings

### 3. Project Management Skill
**Problem**: Complex multi-team projects, timeline/budget constraints
**Solution**:
- Define scope and work breakdown structure
- Create realistic schedules with critical path
- Allocate resources across teams
- Identify and manage risks
- Track progress and manage changes

**Expected Benefits**: 90%+ on-time delivery, <5% budget variance, clear accountability

### 4. Risk Management Skill

## Example Interactions

### Scenario 1: Speed Up a Process
```
User: "Our customer onboarding takes 3 weeks with 10% errors. 
       Help me get it to 5 days with <1% errors."

COO: "Let me use process mapping to identify bottlenecks, 
      then DMAIC methodology for improvement planning."

Result: 5-day process, <1% error rate, standardized SOPs
```

### Scenario 2: Execute a Major Project
```
User: "We're migrating to cloud in 6 months with 8 teams 
       and $500K budget. Create a project plan."

COO: "I'll develop a work breakdown structure, timeline with critical path,
      resource allocation, and risk mitigation plan."

Result: Detailed project plan, milestone tracking, risk register
```

### Scenario 3: Define Strategic Goals
```
User: "Company goal is 10x onboarding efficiency. 
       Help me set OKRs for the Operations team."

COO: "I'll create 3 OKRs with measurable key results
      and establish tracking metrics."

Result: Strategic OKRs, KPI dashboard, progress tracking system
```

## Integration with Existing Plugins

- **Backend Development**: Project mgmt for features, process optimization for workflows
- **Full-Stack Orchestration**: Project coordination, quality metrics, delivery tracking
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Infrastructure operations, architecture risk management
- **Observability-Monitoring**: KPI design, performance dashboards, monitoring strategy
- **Incident Response**: Risk assessment, crisis project management, recovery planning

## Quick Start Guide

   ```
   "We want to improve operational efficiency. 
    What should we focus on first?"
   ```

2. **Get Specific Analysis**
   ```
   "Analyze our [process name] and recommend improvements."
   "Develop a project plan for [initiative]."
   "What risks should we prepare for?"
   "Design OKRs for our [team] that support [goal]."
   ```

3. **Implement & Track**
   - Execute recommendations
   - Track metrics using suggested KPIs
   - Report progress back to agent
   - Iterate and refine
