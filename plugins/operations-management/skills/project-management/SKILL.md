# Project Management Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning complex multi-phase projects with dependencies
- Managing project scope, schedule, budget, and resources
- Coordinating cross-functional teams and external partners
- Identifying and managing project risks and issues
- Tracking project progress and health indicators
- Creating project schedules and milestones
- Managing stakeholder communication and expectations
- Handling project changes and scope creep prevention

## Core Concepts

### Project Planning Fundamentals

**Triple Constraint (Iron Triangle)**:
Every project must balance three factors - you can't optimize all three simultaneously:
- **Scope**: What is included in the project? (features, deliverables)
- **Time**: How long will it take? (schedule, milestones)
- **Cost**: What's the budget? (resources, money)

The project manager's job is to balance these constraints based on priorities. For example:
- Fast + High Quality = High Cost
- Fast + Low Cost = Lower Quality
- High Quality + Low Cost = Takes Longer

**Define Clear Objectives**:
- What is the business problem we're solving?
- What success looks like (SMART goals)
- Who are the key stakeholders?
- What constraints exist (budget, timeline, resources)?

### Project Phases & Lifecycle

**Traditional Waterfall Phases**:

1. **Initiation**: Define project charter and business case
   - Stakeholder identification
   - High-level requirements and goals
   - Resource and budget approval
   - Kick-off meeting with team

2. **Planning**: Develop detailed project plan
   - Requirements and scope definition
   - Work breakdown structure (WBS)
   - Schedule and timeline
   - Budget and resource allocation
   - Risk management plan
   - Communication plan

3. **Execution**: Do the work
   - Team coordination and communication
   - Quality assurance and testing
   - Resource management
   - Issue and change management
   - Stakeholder updates

4. **Monitoring & Control**: Track progress
   - Progress tracking against plan
   - Budget tracking and cost management
   - Schedule tracking and timeline management
   - Quality assurance and testing
   - Risk monitoring and issue resolution

5. **Closure**: Wrap up and transition
   - Final deliverable handoff
   - Project lessons learned
   - Team recognition and retrospective
   - Resource release and reallocation

### Schedule Development

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**:
- Hierarchical decomposition of all project work
- Breaks large project into manageable chunks
- Each level more detailed than the previous
- Example: Product Launch → Marketing → Content Creation → Blog Posts

**Task Definition**:
- What specific work needs to be done?
- Who is responsible?
- What are the dependencies (what must be done first)?
- How long will it take (estimate)?
- What resources are needed?

**Gantt Charts & Timeline**:
- Visual representation of project schedule
- Shows tasks, duration, and dependencies
- Critical path = longest sequence of dependent tasks
- Helps identify scheduling conflicts
- Shows resource utilization

**Milestone Planning**:
- Major milestones mark phase completions
- Should be significant, measurable checkpoints
- Examples: "Scope Approved", "Design Complete", "Testing Started"
- Help track overall project progress
- Used for executive reporting

### Resource Management

**Resource Planning**:
- What skills and roles are needed?
- How many people and for how long?
- What equipment or tools are required?
- When are resources needed? (timeline)
- What's the cost? (budget planning)

**Team Structure & Roles**:
- **Project Manager**: Owns timeline, scope, and stakeholder management
- **Sponsor**: Executive champion who approves budget and scope changes
- **Team Leads**: Manage specific functional areas or workstreams
- **Team Members**: Do the actual work
- **Stakeholders**: Affected by or provide input to the project

**Capacity & Utilization**:
- Avoid overallocating people (100% on multiple projects)
- Account for context switching costs
- Plan for vacation, training, and other commitments
- Build in buffer for unexpected issues

### Risk Management

**Risk Identification**:
- What could go wrong?
- What external factors could impact the project?
- What dependencies could create risk?
- What assumptions might not hold true?

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Probability**: How likely is this to occur? (High, Medium, Low)
- **Impact**: What would be the effect? (High, Medium, Low)
- **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact = Priority

**Risk Mitigation**:
- **Avoid**: Change scope or approach to eliminate risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to vendor or partner
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and plan contingency

**Contingency Planning**:
- Plan B: What if this risk occurs?
- Who will execute contingency plan?
- What resources are needed?
- Timeline impact?

### Tracking & Control

**Progress Metrics**:
- **Schedule Performance**: % complete on time (Earned Value)
- **Budget Performance**: % of budget spent for work completed
- **Quality Metrics**: Defects, rework, customer satisfaction
- **Resource Utilization**: Actual hours vs. planned hours
- **Risk Status**: Active risks and their status

**Status Reporting**:
- Regular updates on scope, schedule, budget
- Issues and risks requiring attention
- Decision points or approvals needed
- Upcoming milestones and dependencies
- Stakeholder communication

**Issue Management**:
- Track open issues and decisions needed
- Assign owner for each issue
- Set resolution deadline
- Document impact if not resolved
- Regular review and escalation

## Project Management Approaches

### Agile/Scrum (Iterative)
- Shorter cycles (2-week sprints)
- Regular demos and feedback
- Flexible scope with fixed timeline
- Better for uncertain requirements
- Higher customer engagement

### Waterfall (Sequential)
- All planning upfront
- Phase gates and approvals
- Clear, stable requirements
- Good for regulated industries
- Lower risk of scope change

### Hybrid Approaches
- Plan high-level roadmap upfront
- Execute iterations with agile
- Gate approvals at phase boundaries
- Combine benefits of both
