# Cloud Developer Advocacy

## When to Use This Skill

- Разработать developer advocacy program с нуля
- Построить и масштабировать developer community
- Спланировать technical content strategy (tutorials, docs, code samples)
- Организовать developer events (meetups, hackathons, conferences)
- Измерить developer marketing effectiveness
- Integrate developer feedback в product roadmap

## Core Concepts

### 1. Developer Advocacy Framework

```
Developer Advocacy = Technical Marketing + Community Building + Product Feedback Loop

Key Principles:
├── Authenticity: Developers detect BS instantly (be honest, technical, helpful)
├── Education-first: Teach, don't sell (value before pitch)
├── Community-driven: Enable community to help each other
├── Open source aligned: Contribute, sponsor, respect OSS values
└── Product feedback: Advocates are voice of developers to product team

Developer Advocate Roles:
├── Content Creator (tutorials, blog posts, videos, code samples)
├── Speaker (conferences, meetups, webinars, workshops)
├── Community Builder (forums, Slack/Discord, meetups, events)
├── Product Feedback (collect, synthesize, advocate for developers)
├── Support Escalation (help with complex technical issues)
└── Evangelist (promote platform, features, best practices)
```
