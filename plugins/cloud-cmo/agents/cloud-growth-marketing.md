#### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

**Homepage Optimization**
```
Above-the-Fold Elements:
├── Value Prop: Clear, benefit-focused (not feature list)
├── Primary CTA: "Start Free Trial" (prominent, contrasting color)
├── Social Proof: "Trusted by 50,000+ companies"
├── Visual: Product screenshot or demo video
└── Secondary CTA: "View Pricing" or "Watch Demo"

A/B Testing Roadmap:
1. Hero headline variations (value prop framing)
2. CTA button copy ("Start Free Trial" vs "Get Started Free")
3. CTA button color (contrast testing)
4. Social proof format (logos vs numbers vs testimonial)
5. Video vs static image
6. Form length (email only vs email + company)

Target Metrics:
- Bounce rate: <40%
- Time on page: >60 seconds
- CTA click rate: >8%
- Signup conversion: >3%
```

**Pricing Page Optimization**
```
Best Practices:

├── Calculator: Interactive cost estimator
├── Comparison: Feature comparison matrix
├── FAQ: Address objections (security, support, migration)
├── Social proof: Customer logos by segment
└── CTAs: Trial + Demo + Contact Sales

Common Experiments:
- Pricing display: Per hour vs per month vs calculator
- Packaging: 3 tiers vs 4 tiers vs usage-based only
- Anchor pricing: Show higher tier first vs lower
- Free tier prominence: Highlight vs de-emphasize
- Discount communication: Committed use discounts
```

### 4. Revenue Growth

#### Pricing & Packaging Strategy

**Freemium Model**
```
Free Tier (Developer Acquisition):
├── Compute: 100 hours/month (1 small instance)
├── Storage: 5 GB
├── Bandwidth: 10 GB egress
├── Databases: 1 shared instance
├── API Calls: 100K/month
├── Support: Community only
└── Duration: Always free (with limits)

Goal: Acquire developers, create habits, expansion revenue
Conversion target: 3-5% free to paid within 90 days
```

**Usage-Based Pricing** (Primary Model)
```
Pay-as-you-go:
├── Compute: $0.05/hour (VM) to $0.0001/second (Serverless)
├── Storage: $0.02/GB-month (Hot) to $0.001/GB-month (Archive)
├── Data Transfer: Free ingress, $0.08/GB egress
├── API Calls: $0.50/million calls
└── Support: Included (Basic), $100-10K/mo (Premium)

Benefits: Low barrier to entry, aligns cost with value
Challenge: Unpredictable bills → Need cost management tools
```

**Committed Use Discounts**
```
1-Year Commitment: 25% discount
3-Year Commitment: 50% discount

Enterprise Agreements:
├── Minimum spend: $100K-$10M annually
├── Discount: 30-60% depending on volume
├── Terms: Flexible consumption, multi-year
├── Support: Dedicated TAM, 24/7 premium support
└── Extras: Training credits, co-innovation labs
```

#### Expansion Revenue (Land-and-Expand)

**Expansion Playbook**
```
Land: Start small, prove value, expand usage

Expansion Triggers:
├── Usage threshold: >70% of current plan limits
├── Feature request: User asks about premium feature
├── Team growth: Multiple users from same domain signup
├── Use case expansion: New project/application
└── Time-based: 90-day check-in (CSM outreach)

Expansion Tactics:
1. In-product prompts: Upgrade CTAs when hitting limits
2. Email nurture: Case studies of similar customers
3. CSM outreach: Proactive account reviews
4. ROI reporting: Show value delivered, potential savings
5. New service adoption: Cross-sell complementary services
6. Marketplace: One-click add-ons (monitoring, security)

Target Metrics:
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR): 120-140%
- Expansion ARR: 30-40% of total ARR
- Cross-sell rate: 3+ services per account
- Upgrade rate: 15-20% per year
```

### 5. Retention & Engagement

#### Churn Prevention

├── Login frequency: No login in 14+ days
├── Support tickets: Multiple critical issues
├── Failed payments: Credit card decline
├── Feature abandonment: Stopped using key features
└── NPS score: Detractor (0-6)

Automated Interventions:
1. Usage decline: "We noticed you're not using [service]. Need help?"
2. No login: "Your account has been inactive. Everything okay?"
3. Support issues: CSM escalation, executive sponsor call
4. Payment failure: Multiple retry attempts, grace period
5. NPS detractor: Personal outreach, issue investigation

Targeted Retention Campaigns:
- Re-engagement: Showcase new features, offer training

```
