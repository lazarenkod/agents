## Базовые концепции

### 1. Типы Сложных Разговоров

**Таксономия Difficult Conversations:**

```
Type 1: Performance Feedback (Negative)
- "Your performance is below expectations"
- "You're not ready for promotion"
- "You need to be on a Performance Improvement Plan"

Type 2: Career Expectations (Mismatch)
- "We're not promoting you this cycle"
- "That role isn't the right fit for you"
- "Your career growth may be slower here"

Type 3: Compensation (Disappointment)
- "We can't match that competing offer"
- "Your salary increase is below market"
- "No bonus this year due to performance"

Type 4: Organizational Changes (Disruption)
- "We're restructuring your team"
- "Your role is being eliminated"
- "You're being reassigned to a new team/manager"

Type 5: Behavioral Issues (Conflict)
- "Your behavior is creating problems on the team"
- "You need to improve your collaboration"
- "We've received complaints about your communication"

Type 6: Personal Situations (Sensitive)
- "We can't accommodate that request (remote work, sabbatical, etc.)"
- "Your personal situation is affecting your work"
- "We're concerned about burnout"

Each type requires different approach, but share common principles
```

### 2. Core Framework: Crucial Conversations

**From "Crucial Conversations" (Patterson, Grenny, McMillan, Switzler):**

```
Definition of Crucial Conversation:
- Stakes are high (career, relationship, wellbeing)
- Opinions vary (you and employee disagree)
- Emotions run strong (fear, anger, disappointment)

STATE Framework for Difficult Conversations:

S - Share your facts
  "I've observed that you've missed 3 deadlines in the past quarter."
  (Not: "You're unreliable" - that's opinion, not fact)

T - Tell your story
  "I'm concerned this pattern may impact your performance rating."
  (Share your interpretation, not as absolute truth)

A - Ask for their path
  "What's your perspective? What's been going on?"
  (Invite dialogue, not monologue)

T - Talk tentatively
  "I may be wrong, but it seems like..."
  (Avoid absolute statements that shut down conversation)

E - Encourage testing
  "Does this align with your view? What am I missing?"
  (Make it safe to disagree)
```

**Psychological Safety in Difficult Conversations:**

```
Create Safety First (before delivering hard message):

Mutual Purpose:
"I want what's best for you and the team. My goal is to help you succeed."

Mutual Respect:
"I respect your contributions. This conversation is about growth, not judgment."

Physical Setup:
- Private space (not open office)
- Comfortable seating (not across desk)
- Tissue box available
- 60 min blocked (don't rush)
- No interruptions (silence phone)

Timing:
✓ Earlier in week (gives them time to process)
✓ Mid-morning (not first thing or end of day)
✓ Not before/after PTO (don't ruin vacation)
✗ Never in group settings
✗ Never via email or Slack
✗ Never right before performance review deadline
```

## Сценарии Сложных Разговоров

### Scenario 1: Promotion Denied

**Situation:** Employee expected promotion, but you're not promoting them this cycle.

**Conversation Script:**

```
Opening:
"I wanted to talk about the promotion discussion we've had. I know you were hoping to be promoted to Senior Engineer this cycle."

Deliver Message:
"After reviewing your performance and comparing against the Senior Engineer criteria, the decision is to not move forward with a promotion at this time. I want to explain why and discuss the path forward."

Provide Specific Feedback:
"Here's where you stand against Senior criteria:
✓ Technical skills: Strong (4/5) - you're solid here
✗ System design: Developing (2/5) - you haven't led complex designs yet
✗ Mentorship: Minimal (1/5) - no evidence of mentoring junior engineers
✗ Cross-functional collaboration: Inconsistent (2/5)

To be clear: You're a strong engineer. You're not ready for Senior yet."

Invite Response:
"I know this is disappointing. What's your reaction? What questions do you have?"

[LISTEN - they may be upset, defensive, or silent]

Address Emotions:
"I understand you're frustrated. Your feelings are valid. This doesn't mean you're not valued - it means we have work to do to get you ready."

Path Forward:
"Here's the plan to get you promoted in the next 6-12 months:

1. System Design (Next 3 months):
   - Lead design for [specific project]
   - Present at architecture review
   - Shadow Staff Engineer in design meetings

2. Mentorship (Next 3 months):
   - Take on 2 junior engineers as mentees
   - Conduct code reviews and pair programming
   - Present at Engineering Lunch & Learn

3. Collaboration (Ongoing):
   - Partner with PM and Design on [project]
   - Improve communication in standups (be proactive)
   - Build relationships with cross-functional peers

We'll check in monthly on progress. If you execute well, we can revisit promotion in Q2."

Close:
"I'm committed to helping you get there. This is not a 'no forever' - it's a 'not yet.'
How does this plan sound? What support do you need from me?"

Follow-Up (within 24 hours):
Email summarizing criteria, feedback, and development plan.
```

**Common Reactions & Responses:**

```
Reaction: "But I've been here 2 years! I deserve this!"
Response: "I understand tenure matters. And, promotion is based on impact and competencies, not time served. Let's focus on closing the gaps so you're ready next cycle."

Reaction: "Everyone else got promoted except me."
Response: "I can't discuss other people's promotions. What I can say is that each person's readiness is evaluated individually. Let's focus on your development."

Reaction: "I'm going to start looking for another job."
Response: "I'd be sad to lose you, and I respect your choice. If you're open to it, I'd love to help you succeed here. But if you decide to leave, I'll support you."

Reaction: "This is unfair / biased."
Response: "I take that concern seriously. Can you help me understand what feels unfair? I'm committed to fair evaluations, and if I've missed something, I want to know."
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Issues (Critical Feedback)

**Situation:** Employee's performance has declined; needs to improve or will be on PIP.

**Conversation Script:**

```
Opening:
"I need to have a serious conversation about your performance. This is important, and I want to be direct."

Deliver Message:
"Over the past 3 months, I've observed concerning patterns:
1. Quality: 12 bugs in prod (team average: 3)
2. Deadlines: Missed 2 project deadlines by 2-3 weeks
3. Communication: Failed to escalate blockers, causing surprises

This is below expectations for your level. If we don't see improvement, we'll need to put you on a Performance Improvement Plan."

Pause for Impact:
[Let them absorb. Don't rush to fill silence.]

Invite Response:
"I want to understand what's happening. What's your perspective?"

[LISTEN for root causes: Personal issues? Burnout? Skill gap? Misalignment?]

Empathize (if appropriate):
"I hear that you've been struggling with [personal situation]. I appreciate you sharing that."

Set Expectations:
"Here's what needs to change immediately:

1. Quality: Code review checklist, pair programming with Senior Eng, testing protocol
2. Deadlines: Weekly check-ins, flag risks 1 week in advance, ask for help early
3. Communication: Daily standup updates, Slack blockers within 24hrs

Timeline: I need to see consistent improvement over the next 30 days. We'll check in weekly."

Consequences:
"To be clear: If I don't see improvement, we'll move to a formal Performance Improvement Plan. If performance doesn't improve on PIP, it may result in termination. I don't want that outcome - I want you to succeed."

Support:
"Here's how I'll support you:
- Weekly 1-on-1s (not just monthly)
- Pair you with Senior Engineer mentor
- Prioritize your workload (reduce scope if needed)
- Connect you with resources (courses, coaching)

What else do you need?"

Close:
"This is serious, and it's also fixable. I believe you can turn this around.
How are you feeling? What questions do you have?"

Follow-Up:
Document conversation in writing (email summary within 24 hrs)
Share with HR (create paper trail)
Schedule weekly check-ins
```

**Handling Defensive Reactions:**

```
Reaction: "This is the first I'm hearing of this!"
Response: "I should have given you feedback sooner - that's on me. Moving forward, I'll be more direct and timely. For now, let's focus on what we do from here."

Reaction: "It's not my fault - the specs were unclear / the PM changed requirements."
Response: "I hear that there were challenges. And, part of your role is to navigate ambiguity and communicate early. Let's talk about how you can handle that differently."

Reaction: "I'm doing my best! This is unfair."
Response: "I don't doubt your effort. And, effort alone isn't the measure - it's outcomes. Let's figure out how to get you the support you need to deliver better outcomes."

Reaction: [Tears, emotional breakdown]
Response: "Take a moment. It's okay to feel upset. [Pause, offer tissue] When you're ready, let's talk about how we move forward."
```

### Scenario 3: Compensation Disappointment

**Situation:** Employee received a raise, but it's below their expectations.

**Conversation Script:**

```
Opening:
"I want to discuss your compensation review. I know you were hoping for a larger increase."

Deliver Message:
"Your raise this year is 4% ($4K on $100K base). I understand this may be lower than you expected."

Provide Context:
"Here's how we arrived at this number:
- Company budget: 3.5% average raise pool
- Your performance: Meets Expectations (solid, not exceeds)
- Market data: You're at 60th percentile of market (Pave data)
- Equity: You also received $20K RSU refresh

Total comp increase: ~$24K (4% cash + $5K equity/year)"

Invite Response:
"I know this might not be what you hoped for. What's your reaction?"

[LISTEN - they may express disappointment, frustration, or threaten to leave]

Address Concerns:
"I hear that you're frustrated. Let me address what I can:

If concern is market comp:
'Our data shows you're at 60th percentile. If you have data showing you're underpaid, I'm open to reviewing.'

If concern is performance:
'This raise reflects 'Meets Expectations' performance. To get a larger raise next year, aim for 'Exceeds Expectations' by [specific goals].'

If concern is competing offer:
'If you have a competing offer, I'd like to understand it. We may not be able to match, but I want to discuss.'"

Path Forward:
"Here's what I can offer:
1. Larger raise next cycle (if you exceed expectations)
2. Promotion consideration (if you're ready in 6-12 months)
3. Off-cycle adjustment (if market data shows underpayment)
4. Non-comp benefits (flexible work, conference budget, etc.)

What matters most to you?"

Close:
"I value you on this team. I'm committed to fair compensation. Let's revisit this in 6 months and see where you stand."

Follow-Up:
Email with comp breakdown, market data, and path to higher comp
```

**Handling "I Have Another Offer" Conversations:**

```
Employee: "I have an offer for $150K (you pay $100K). Can you match?"

Response Framework:
1. Gather information:
   "Tell me about the offer. What's the role, company, total comp (base + bonus + equity)?"

2. Assess internal equity:
   "Let me review our comp bands and your performance. I need to ensure any adjustment is fair to the team."

3. Options:
   a) Match (if they're underpaid and high performer)
   b) Counter with less (meet partway)
   c) Let them go (if offer is above market or they're not critical retention)

4. Decision factors:
   - Are they underpaid? (use market data)
   - Are they a top performer? (retain at all costs)
   - Is offer reasonable? (not just inflated for negotiation)
   - Will matching create internal inequity?

5. Response:
   If matching: "I value you. Let me talk to leadership and HR. I'll have an answer in 48 hours."
   If not matching: "I can't match that offer - it's above our bands. I'd be sad to lose you, but I respect your decision."
```

### Scenario 4: Career Plateau

**Situation:** Employee has been at same level for 3+ years, not progressing.

**Conversation Script:**

```
Opening:
"I want to have a career conversation. I've noticed you've been at the Senior level for 3 years, and I want to check in on your goals."

Invite Perspective:
"How are you feeling about your career here? Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"

[LISTEN - they may say: "I want to be Staff" or "I'm not sure" or "I feel stuck"]

Deliver Honest Assessment:
"Here's my honest view: You're a strong Senior Engineer, and I don't see you at Staff level in the next 1-2 years. Let me explain why."

Provide Specific Feedback:
"Staff Engineer criteria:
✗ Technical leadership: You haven't driven org-level technical decisions
✗ Scope: You work within your team, not across teams
✗ Strategic impact: You execute well, but don't drive strategy
✓ Technical depth: You're strong here

To be clear: Not everyone needs to be Staff. It's a high bar, and many excellent engineers stay at Senior."

Explore Options:
"Here are your options:

Option 1: Pursue Staff (2-3 year path)
   - Take on cross-team technical leadership
   - Drive architectural decisions
   - Build influence beyond your team
   - Risk: Might not get there (competition is high)

Option 2: Stay at Senior, deepen expertise
   - Become domain expert (e.g., ML infrastructure, security)
   - High impact at Senior level
   - More sustainable (less pressure than Staff race)

Option 3: Management track
   - Lead a small team (4-6 people)
   - Develop people leadership skills
   - Different path to impact

Which resonates with you?"

Path Forward:
Based on their choice, create development plan:

If Staff: Stretch projects, exec visibility, mentorship
If Deep Senior: Domain expertise, training, conference speaking
If Management: Manager training, shadow current manager, hire for your replacement

Close:
"Career growth isn't always linear or upward. It's about impact and fulfillment. Let's design a path that works for you."
```

### Scenario 5: Behavioral Issues (Conflict)

**Situation:** Employee's behavior is creating problems (e.g., disrespectful communication, not collaborating).

**Conversation Script:**

```
Opening:
"I need to discuss your interactions with the team. I've received feedback about communication that I want to address."

Deliver Specific Feedback:
"I've heard from multiple people that your communication can be dismissive and disrespectful. For example:
- In last week's design review, you said 'This idea is stupid' (quoted)
- In Slack, you wrote 'This is a waste of time' when PM shared a proposal
- Team members feel you interrupt them in meetings

This creates a toxic environment and violates our values."

Pause:
[Let them absorb. Behavioral feedback is often met with defensiveness.]

Invite Response:
"What's your perspective? Are you aware of how you're coming across?"

[LISTEN - they may deny, justify, or acknowledge]

Address Defensiveness:
If they deny: "I have multiple reports from different people. This is a pattern, not isolated. Let's focus on what we do next."

If they justify: "I understand you value directness. And, there's a difference between direct and dismissive. Let's discuss how to be direct with respect."

If they acknowledge: "I appreciate your self-awareness. Let's talk about how to change the behavior."

Set Clear Expectations:
"Here's what needs to change immediately:

1. Language: No dismissive words ('stupid', 'waste of time', 'terrible')
2. Meetings: Let others finish before speaking. Disagree respectfully.
3. Slack: Pause before hitting send. Ask: 'Is this respectful?'
4. Feedback: Use 'I disagree because...' not 'You're wrong'

This isn't optional. This is a performance expectation."

Consequences:
"If the behavior continues, we'll move to formal disciplinary action. In extreme cases, this can lead to termination."

Support:
"I'll support you:
- Communication coach (I'll arrange)
- Feedback after meetings (I'll give you real-time input)
- Check-ins (weekly, to track progress)

But the change has to come from you."

Close:
"I believe you can do this. You're talented, and I want you on this team. Let's make this work."

Follow-Up:
Email summarizing expectations, timeline, and support
Document conversation (share with HR)
Monitor closely (check in with team for feedback)
```

## Advanced: Handling Extreme Reactions

**Angry Response:**

```
Employee raises voice, gets aggressive.

Response:
"I can see you're upset. I need us to keep this conversation professional. If you need a moment, we can pause and reconvene tomorrow."

If they continue:
"I'm going to end this conversation now. Let's reschedule when we can discuss this calmly."

If they become threatening:
"I'm ending this meeting. [Stand up, open door, call HR if needed]"

After the conversation:
- Document everything (quotes, timeline)
- Notify HR immediately
- Do not meet alone again (HR present in future meetings)
```

**Emotional Breakdown (Crying):**

```
Employee starts crying.

Response:
"Take your time. It's okay. [Offer tissue, pause]"

[Wait until they're ready to continue]

"I know this is hard. Do you want to continue or take a break?"

If they want to continue:
Proceed gently, check in frequently ("How are you doing?")

If they need a break:
"Let's reconvene tomorrow. Take care of yourself today."

Don't:
✗ Say "Don't cry" (invalidates emotions)
✗ Rush through the conversation
✗ Get uncomfortable and back down on message
✗ Hug or touch them (boundary issue)
```

**Threats to Quit:**

```
Employee: "If you're not promoting me, I'm going to leave."

Response:
"I'd be sad to lose you. And, I can't promote you just to retain you - that wouldn't be fair to others. I care about your career here, but I also respect your choice."

Follow-up:
"If you do decide to explore other opportunities, I'll support you with references. But I hope you'll consider the development plan we discussed."

Don't:
✗ Panic and make promises you can't keep
✗ Get defensive or angry
✗ Beg them to stay (they'll use it as leverage)
✗ Badmouth them or the company
```

**Legal Threats ("I'll sue"):**

```
Employee threatens legal action.

Response:
"I take that seriously. Let me involve HR so we can address your concerns properly."

[Immediately contact HR, do not continue conversation alone]

Don't:
✗ Try to talk them out of it
✗ Make any commitments
✗ Argue or defend
✗ Continue the conversation without HR/legal
```

## Metrics & Follow-Up

**Tracking Difficult Conversations:**

```
