# Executive Search & Leadership Hiring

Поиск и найм топ-менеджеров (C-level executives и VPs) на основе практик ведущих технологических компаний: AWS, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Stripe.

## Формат работы и сохранение результатов

- Всегда отвечай на русском языке и сохраняй артефакты через Write tool в markdown.
- Используй путь `outputs/hr-business-partner/skills/executive-search-leadership-hiring/{timestamp}_{case}.md`.
- Каждый поиск веди в трех циклах: Диагностика роли/контекста → Проектирование стратегии (воронка, ассессмент, compensation) → Валидация и утверждение решений (оффер, onboarding, KPI).
- В отчете фиксируй профиль роли, критерии успеха, карту интервьюеров, метрики воронки, бюджет и задействованные assets/references.

## Asset & Reference Toolkit

- **Assets**: `assets/executive-profile-template.md`, `assets/executive-interview-questions.md`, `assets/reference-check-script.md`, `assets/executive-scorecard.md`, `assets/compensation-benchmarking-template.md`, `assets/30-60-90-onboarding-plan.md`, `assets/executive-search-rfp-template.md`.
- **References**: `references/market-compensation-benchmarks.md`, `references/board-alignment-guide.md`, `references/candidate-due-diligence-checklist.md`, `references/search-firm-landscape.md`.
- Все промежуточные данные (pipeline, DEI метрики, compensation) обязательно прикрепляй к итоговому markdown.

## Базовые концепции

### 1. Executive Search Process

**Retained Executive Search vs Internal Recruiting**

```
Retained Search (для C-level, critical VPs):
- Executive search firm на retainer ($50K-150K upfront)
- Dedicated search (exclusivity)
- 90-120 day timeline
- Access to passive candidates (not actively looking)
- Confidential searches (replacing current executive)
- Firms: Spencer Stuart, Heidrick & Struggles, Korn Ferry, Russell Reynolds

Internal Recruiting (для VPs, directors):
- In-house recruiting team
- No retainer fee
- 60-90 day timeline
- Active candidates + network referrals
- Cost-effective for known talent pools

When to use retained search:
✓ CEO, CFO, CTO positions
✓ Confidential replacements
✓ Niche expertise (e.g., AI research leader, cybersecurity CISO)
✓ Need access to passive candidates at competitor companies
✗ When you have strong internal pipeline
✗ Budget constraints (retained search = $200K-500K total cost)
```

**Executive Search Timeline:**

```
Phase 1: Intake & Strategy (Week 1-2)
- Kickoff meeting with CEO/Board
- Define executive profile (must-haves, nice-to-haves)
- Agree on compensation range ($300K-$2M+ for C-level)
- Identify target companies and competitive landscape
- Define success metrics for first 12-18 months

Phase 2: Research & Sourcing (Week 3-6)
- Map market (identify 100+ potential candidates)
- Outreach to passive candidates (50-80 conversations)
- Screen candidates against profile
- Create shortlist (8-12 qualified candidates)

Phase 3: Assessment (Week 7-10)
- First round interviews (Zoom, 60 min)
- Second round (onsite, full day with team)
- Executive assessment (psychometric, case studies)
- Reference checks (in-depth, 5-8 references)

Phase 4: Final Selection (Week 11-12)
- Final round with CEO + Board
- Offer negotiation (comp, equity, start date)
- Background check (financial, criminal, education)
- Offer acceptance and announcement

Phase 5: Onboarding (Week 13+)
- Executive onboarding plan (first 30-60-90 days)
- Board introduction and expectations setting
- Team meetings and stakeholder alignment
```

### 2. Executive Profile Definition

- Long-term Orientation: Balance short-term vs long-term

2. Leadership & People (25%)
- Team Building: Attract, hire, develop world-class teams
- Coaching: Develop leaders, succession planning
- Culture: Shape and reinforce organizational culture
- Inspiration: Motivate and align teams around vision

3. Execution Excellence (20%)
- Results: Track record of delivering outcomes

- Network: Strong relationships in industry
- Continuous Learning: Stay current, curious mindset
```

**Executive Assessment Methods:**

**Method 1: Case Study Interview (3-4 hours)**
```
Present real business challenge:
"Our engineering velocity has decreased 40% over the past year as we scaled from 50 to 150 engineers. Retention is down, engagement scores dropped from 4.5 to 3.8, and we're missing product deadlines. As CTO, how would you diagnose and address this?"

Evaluation:
- How do they structure the problem? (frameworks, first principles)
- What questions do they ask? (depth of inquiry)
- What hypotheses do they generate? (strategic thinking)
- How do they prioritize actions? (execution focus)
- How do they communicate recommendations? (clarity, influence)

Strong Answer Includes:
✓ Root cause analysis (data, interviews, skip-levels)
✓ Multiple hypotheses (hiring quality, tech debt, processes, leadership)
✓ Prioritized action plan (quick wins + systemic fixes)
✓ Metrics to track progress (velocity, retention, engagement, delivery)
✓ Stakeholder management (CEO, Board, team communication)
```

**Method 2: Behavioral Interview (Leadership Principles)**
```
Amazon-style behavioral questions targeting executive competencies:

Strategic Thinking:
"Tell me about the most complex strategic decision you've made as a leader."
- Look for: Data-driven, considered alternatives, clear rationale, measurable outcomes

Leadership:
"Describe a time when you had to transform an underperforming team."
- Look for: Diagnosis, people decisions, coaching, results, retention of high performers

Execution:
"Tell me about a time you missed a critical deadline. What happened and how did you handle it?"
- Look for: Accountability, learnings, process improvements, communication

Influence:
"Describe a situation where you had to influence the Board or CEO on a controversial decision."
- Look for: Data + storytelling, handling objections, building consensus, outcome

Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and probe for depth
```

**Method 3: Executive Assessment Center (Full Day)**
```
Schedule: 8am - 5pm at company office

8:00am - Breakfast with CEO (informal, culture fit)
9:00am - Case study presentation to Executive Team (90 min)
10:30am - Technical deep dive with Engineering VPs (60 min)
12:00pm - Lunch with future direct reports (informal, team dynamics)
1:30pm - Stakeholder management role-play (60 min)
  - Scenario: "Board member is concerned about engineering costs. Present budget for next year."
3:00pm - Problem-solving session with engineers (60 min)
  - Whiteboard technical architecture challenge
4:00pm - Final interview with CEO + Board member (60 min)
5:00pm - Debrief with candidate (Q&A, sell the role)

All interviewers complete scorecards immediately after (before debrief meeting)
```

**Method 4: Psychometric Assessments**
```
Tools for executive assessment:
- Hogan Assessments (personality, values, judgment)
- Korn Ferry Leadership Architect (competencies)
- Predictive Index (behavioral drives, cognitive ability)
- 360-Degree Leadership Feedback (for internal candidates)

Use as supplementary data, not primary decision driver
Best for: Identifying development areas, onboarding focus, team dynamics
```

### 4. Reference Checking (Executive Level)

**Executive reference checking is more rigorous than IC-level:**

```
Quantity: 5-8 references (vs. 2-3 for ICs)
- 2 former managers/CEOs
- 2-3 former peers (fellow executives)
- 2-3 former direct reports
- Optional: Board members, investors, customers

Sources:
- Candidate-provided references (3-4)
- Back-channel references (2-4) - people NOT provided by candidate

Process:
1. Schedule 30-45 min phone calls (not email)
2. Build rapport first (explain your role, company, position)
3. Ask open-ended questions
4. Listen for hesitations, what they DON'T say
5. Probe for specifics (examples, not generalizations)
```

**Executive Reference Check Questions:**

```markdown
## Reference Call Script

"Thank you for taking the time. I'm conducting reference checks for [Name] for the CTO role at [Company]. This will take about 30 minutes. Everything you share is confidential."

### Working Relationship
1. "How did you work with [Name]? What was the context?"
2. "What were the biggest challenges facing the organization at that time?"

### Performance & Impact
3. "What were [Name]'s biggest accomplishments during their tenure?"
4. "How did they compare to other executives you've worked with?"
5. "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate their performance? Why that number and not higher?"

### Leadership & People
6. "How would you describe their leadership style?"
7. "How effective were they at building and developing teams?"
8. "What was turnover like on their team? Who left and why?"
9. "How did they handle underperformers?"

### Strengths & Development Areas
10. "What are their top 3 strengths as an executive?"
11. "What are their development areas or growth opportunities?"
12. "If they could improve in one area, what would have the biggest impact?"

### Stakeholder Management
13. "How effective were they at managing up (to CEO/Board)?"
14. "How did they collaborate with peer executives?"
15. "How did they handle conflict or disagreement?"

### Critical Questions
16. "Would you hire them again? Why or why not?"
17. "If I hire them, what advice would you give me for helping them succeed?"
18. "Is there anyone else I should talk to who worked closely with them?"

### Red Flag Probes (if concerns emerge)
- "I heard they can be [challenging behavior]. Can you speak to that?"
- "Tell me about a time when they struggled or failed. How did they handle it?"
- "Some people mentioned [concern]. What's your perspective?"

## What to Listen For

Green Flags:
✓ Enthusiastic endorsement ("I'd hire them again in a heartbeat")
✓ Specific examples and stories (not vague praise)
✓ Balanced feedback (acknowledges development areas but sees strengths)
✓ Strong results and impact (measurable outcomes)
✓ Team loyalty (low turnover, people wanted to work for them)

Red Flags:
✗ Hesitation or lukewarm endorsement ("They're fine...")
✗ Vague or generic feedback ("They're a hard worker")
✗ Avoids questions or changes subject
✗ High turnover on their team or poor retention
✗ Conflict with peers or stakeholders
✗ Lack of self-awareness or accountability
✗ "Would not hire again"

CRITICAL: If you hear red flags, do more back-channel references
```

**Back-Channel References:**

```
What are back-channels?
- References NOT provided by candidate
- People you know in common (LinkedIn, network)
- Former colleagues the candidate didn't list

Why do them?
- Unfiltered perspective (candidate didn't prep them)
- More likely to share concerns
- Triangulate candidate-provided references

How to approach:
1. "I'm considering [Name] for a role and noticed you worked together. Would you be comfortable sharing your perspective? This is confidential."
2. If they hesitate: "No pressure. I understand if you can't comment."
3. Listen carefully for what they DON'T say (hesitations, topic changes)

Ethics:
✓ Always tell candidate you may do back-channels (in offer letter or verbal agreement)
✓ Don't pressure people who are uncomfortable
✓ Keep all feedback confidential
✗ Don't use references to rule out candidate without giving them a chance to respond
```

### 5. Board Involvement in Executive Hiring

**When Does Board Get Involved?**

```
CEO Hiring: Board leads the search (CEO Search Committee)
C-Level (CFO, CTO, CPO): Board interviews finalists (2-3 candidates)
VPs: CEO decision, Board informed but not involved

Board Interview Structure (60-90 min):
- 2-3 Board members (typically CEO + 1-2 others)
- Focus areas:
  1. Strategic vision and market understanding
  2. Leadership and people management
  3. Financial acumen and business judgment
  4. Cultural fit and values alignment
  5. Track record of execution and results

Board Evaluation:
- Strategic thinking: Can they shape company strategy?
- Business judgment: Do they make sound decisions?
- Leadership: Can they build and scale a world-class team?
- Fit: Do they align with company values and culture?
- Risk: Any red flags or concerns?

Board Decision Process:
- Unanimous approval for CEO
- Majority approval for C-level
- Board can veto even if CEO wants to hire
```

### 6. Executive Compensation Packages

**C-Level Compensation Structure:**

```
Total Compensation Components:

1. Base Salary
   - Benchmark: Top 75th percentile of market (Radford, Pave, Option Impact data)
   - Range: $300K-$600K+ (depends on company stage, role, location)

   - CMO/CISO/Chief of Staff: $250K-$400K

2. Annual Bonus (Variable Comp)
   - Target: 50-100% of base salary
   - Structure: Company performance (60%) + Individual performance (40%)
   - Payout: 0-200% of target (depending on performance)
   - Example: $400K base, 50% target = $200K target bonus
     - If company crushes goals: up to $400K (200% payout)
     - If company misses: $0-$100K

3. Equity (Long-Term Incentive)

   - Growth-stage (Series B-D): 0.5-2% of company
   - Late-stage (Pre-IPO): 0.1-0.5% of company
   - Public company: RSUs worth $1M-$5M annually

   Vesting:
   - Standard: 4 years, 1 year cliff, monthly thereafter
   - Acceleration: Single-trigger (on acquisition) for CEO/CLevel often
   - Refresh grants: Annual refreshers to maintain equity value

4. Sign-On Bonus

- Sign-on: $200K
- Year 1 Total: $1.55M
- Ongoing (years 2-4): $1.35M/year
```

**Equity Negotiation (Advanced):**

```
Candidate asks: "Can you increase my equity from 1.5% to 2%?"

Response framework:
1. Acknowledge request: "I understand equity is important. Let's discuss."

2. Provide context:
   "Our equity philosophy:
   - We benchmark against [Pave data for Series C CTOs]
   - Typical range is 1-2% for this role and stage
   - We're offering 1.5%, which is at 75th percentile
   - This represents $3M over 4 years at current valuation"

3. Explore alternatives:
   "If equity is the main concern, we have some options:
   a) Increase equity to 1.75% (split the difference)
   b) Add performance-based equity (earn up to 0.5% more if you hit milestones)
   c) Increase base salary instead (equity has risk, cash is guaranteed)
   d) Accelerated vesting (3-year instead of 4-year)"

4. Understand motivation:
   "Help me understand what's driving this request:
   - Is it about total comp vs. your current role?
   - Are you leaving significant unvested equity?
   - Is there a competing offer?
   - Do you have concerns about our valuation?"

5. Make decision:
   - If reasonable ask + strong candidate: Meet them partway
   - If unreasonable: Hold firm, explain rationale
   - If market mismatch: Provide data, adjust if truly underpaid
```

### 7. Executive Onboarding (30-60-90 Plan)

**C-Level Onboarding is Different:**

```
Key Differences from IC Onboarding:
- More strategic (less tactical)
- Board-level expectations
- Organizational impact (their decisions affect 100s of people)
- External visibility (press, customers, investors)
- Network building (industry relationships)

Executive Onboarding Plan:

## First 30 Days: Learn

✓ Strategic plan approved (Board buy-in on roadmap)
✓ Hiring plan in motion (started recruiting for key roles)
```

## Практические Сценарии

### Scenario 1: Replacing Underperforming CTO

**Situation:** Current CTO is not scaling, need to replace while minimizing disruption.

**Approach:**
```
Phase 1: Decision & Confidentiality (Week 1-2)
- CEO + Board decide CTO needs to be replaced
- Engage executive search firm (confidential search)
- Define CTO profile (what new CTO needs to fix)
- Set timeline (3-4 months to hire, 1 month transition)

Phase 2: Confidential Search (Week 3-12)
- Search firm identifies 50+ candidates
- First rounds conducted offsite or via Zoom (to maintain confidentiality)
- Candidate told: "This is a confidential search, current CTO doesn't know"
- Screen for candidates who can start quickly (2-4 weeks notice)

Phase 3: Transition Plan (Week 13-14)
- New CTO offer accepted
- CEO has transition conversation with outgoing CTO:
  "We've made the difficult decision to make a leadership change.
   We'll announce a transition over the next 30 days.
   We want this to be respectful and collaborative."
- Negotiate separation agreement (severance, equity, announcement)

Phase 4: Announcement & Onboarding (Week 15-16)
- Internal announcement: "CTO is transitioning out, new CTO starting [date]"
- External announcement (press release): "Former CTO moving to advisory role"
- 2-week knowledge transfer (outgoing CTO helps onboard new CTO)
- New CTO starts, begins 30-60-90 plan

Key Success Factors:
✓ Confidentiality (no leaks until decision is final)
✓ Respectful exit (generous severance, positive framing)
✓ Smooth transition (knowledge transfer, team stability)
✓ Quick onboarding (new CTO delivers quick wins in 30 days)
```

### Scenario 2: Building C-Suite from Scratch

**Situation:** Series B startup ($20M raised), CEO + founders, need to hire CFO, CTO, CPO, VP Sales.

**Prioritization:**
```
Hire Order (based on business needs):

1. CTO (Month 1-3):
   - Why first: Technical leadership critical, engineering team needs direction
   - Profile: Experienced scaling eng teams (20 → 100), strong technical vision
   - Timeline: 3 months (retained search)

2. VP Sales (Month 2-4):
   - Why second: Revenue growth is priority after product
   - Profile: Built sales team from $5M to $50M ARR
   - Timeline: 2-3 months (internal recruiting + network)

3. CPO (Month 4-6):
   - Why third: Product strategy needs to be defined
   - Profile: Experience with product-market fit, roadmap, customer research
   - Timeline: 2-3 months

4. CFO (Month 6-9):
   - Why last: Less urgent until Series C raise (18 months out)
   - Profile: Operational CFO (not just finance), experience with hypergrowth
   - Timeline: 3 months (retained search)

Parallel Hiring:
- Don't try to hire all at once (overwhelming for CEO, dilutes focus)
- Start next search when previous hire is 50% through (pipeline)
- Total time: 9 months to fully build C-suite
```

### Scenario 3: Executive Reference Check Red Flags

**Situation:** Strong candidate, but one reference raised concerns about "rough edges in communication."

**Response:**
```
Step 1: Gather More Data
- Do 2-3 additional back-channel references (focus on communication)
- Ask specific questions:
  - "How would you describe their communication style?"
  - "Can you give an example of a challenging communication situation?"
  - "How did they handle feedback or pushback?"

Step 2: Probe with Candidate
- Raise concern directly (with tact):
  "I've heard feedback that you can be very direct in your communication,
   which some people find challenging. Can you talk about your style?"
- Listen for self-awareness:
  - Good: "Yes, I'm direct. I've learned to adapt my style for different audiences."
  - Bad: "I have no idea what they're talking about" (lack of self-awareness)

Step 3: Assess Cultural Fit
- Is "direct communication" a fit with our culture?
  - Netflix: Yes (Radical Candor, feedback culture)
  - Other cultures: Maybe not (if you value "kindness" over "directness")

Step 4: Mitigate with Onboarding
- If you hire them, plan for this:
  - Executive coach (help them adapt communication style)
  - 360-degree feedback (baseline, track progress)
  - Clear expectations from CEO (behavior standards)

Decision Framework:
- Minor concern + self-aware + cultural fit = Hire (with coaching)
- Major concern + not self-aware + poor fit = Don't hire
- Multiple concerning references = Don't hire (pattern of behavior)
```
