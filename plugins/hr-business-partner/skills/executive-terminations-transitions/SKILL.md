## Базовые концепции

### 1. Типы Executive Exits

**Таксономия Executive Terminations:**

```
Type 1: Performance-Based Exit
- Consistent underperformance despite coaching
- Failed to deliver on objectives (OKRs, strategic goals)
- Team dysfunction or high attrition under their leadership
- Loss of Board or CEO confidence

Examples:
- CTO who couldn't scale engineering (missed product deadlines, high turnover)
- CFO who failed to deliver accurate financial reporting
- VP Sales who missed revenue targets 3 quarters in a row

Timeline: 3-6 months (after PIP or coaching period)
Approach: Structured, documented, fair severance

Type 2: Culture Fit or Leadership Style Mismatch
- Executive doesn't align with company values
- Leadership style causes conflict (e.g., authoritarian in collaborative culture)
- Unable to build trust with peers or team
- "Brilliant jerk" syndrome (high performer, toxic behavior)

Examples:
- CMO who is aggressive and dismissive in meetings (violates "respect" value)
- VP Eng who micromanages and doesn't empower team (violates "autonomy" value)

Timeline: 1-3 months (faster than performance, culture issues escalate quickly)
Approach: Respectful, "not the right fit" framing, generous severance

Type 3: Restructuring or Strategic Shift
- Company pivots or changes strategy
- Role becomes redundant (e.g., acquisition, consolidation)
- Budget cuts or layoffs at executive level
- New CEO brings own team

Examples:
- VP of Hardware when company exits hardware business
- CMO when company shifts from B2C to B2B (different skillset needed)
- CFO after acquisition (acquiring company's CFO takes over)

Timeline: 1-2 months (faster for business reasons)
Approach: "Business decision, not performance," generous severance, outplacement

Type 4: Misconduct or Ethics Violation
- Sexual harassment or discrimination
- Financial fraud or embezzlement
- Insider trading or securities violations
- Lying on resume or background check
- Gross negligence or recklessness

Examples:
- CFO commits accounting fraud
- VP Sales bribes clients or manipulates revenue numbers
- CTO leaks confidential information to competitor

Timeline: Immediate (terminate on discovery, often same day)
Approach: Legal-driven, minimal severance, protect company, PR crisis management

Type 5: Voluntary Departure (Resignation, Retirement, Poaching)
- Executive resigns for another opportunity
- Retirement (planned or sudden)
- Personal reasons (health, family, burnout)

Timeline: Standard notice (2-4 weeks) or negotiated transition
Approach: Collaborative, positive framing, knowledge transfer
```

### 2. Legal Considerations (CRITICAL)

**Legal Framework for Executive Terminations:**

```
ALWAYS involve legal counsel BEFORE terminating an executive:

Why?
- Executives often have employment contracts (not at-will)
- Large severance packages ($500K-$5M+) require Board approval
- Risk of litigation (wrongful termination, discrimination, defamation)
- Impact on stock price (public companies)
- Regulatory considerations (SEC filings for public companies)

Legal Checklist Before Termination:

□ Review employment contract
  - Notice period (30-90 days typical)
  - Termination clauses ("for cause" vs "without cause")
  - Severance terms (pre-negotiated amounts)
  - Non-compete, non-solicit, confidentiality obligations
  - Equity vesting (acceleration clauses, repurchase rights)

□ Document performance issues
  - Written performance feedback (emails, reviews, PIPs)
  - Board minutes (discussions of exec performance)
  - 360-degree feedback or engagement data
  - Financial results or OKR achievement (objective data)

□ Check for protected status
  - Age (ADEA - Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 40+ protected)
  - Gender, race, religion, disability (Title VII, ADA)
  - Recent protected activity (whistleblowing, harassment complaint)
  - Pregnancy or family leave (FMLA)

□ Assess litigation risk
  - Executive's personality (litigious vs reasonable)
  - Strength of your documentation (strong case vs weak)
  - Potential claims (discrimination, retaliation, defamation)
  - Public vs private company (PR risk, SEC filings)

□ Draft separation agreement
  - Severance amount and terms
  - Equity treatment (vesting, exercise period)
  - Benefits continuation (COBRA, health insurance)
  - Release of claims (general release, no litigation)
  - Non-disparagement (mutual - both parties)
  - Cooperation clause (litigation, transition, knowledge transfer)
  - Return of company property
  - Confidentiality (trade secrets, customer data)

□ Board approval (if required)
  - CEO termination: Full Board vote
  - C-level: Board or Compensation Committee approval
  - VP: CEO decision (Board informed)
```

**"For Cause" vs "Without Cause" Termination:**

```
"For Cause" Termination:
Definition: Termination due to serious misconduct or gross negligence
Examples:
- Fraud, embezzlement, theft
- Sexual harassment or discrimination
- Willful violation of company policy
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Conviction of felony

Severance: Minimal or none (per contract)
Benefits: No continuation
Equity: Forfeiture (unvested shares lost)

Legal Standard: HIGH (must prove cause, well-documented)
Risk: Litigation if exec disputes "cause" designation

"Without Cause" Termination:
Definition: Termination for any reason not rising to "for cause"
Examples:
- Poor performance (not gross negligence)
- Restructuring or strategic shift
- Loss of confidence
- Culture fit issues

Severance: Full contractual severance (6-24 months salary)
Benefits: COBRA + extended health insurance (6-12 months)
Equity: Partial acceleration (per contract)

Legal Standard: LOW (can terminate for almost any reason, at-will)
Risk: Lower litigation risk, but expensive

BEST PRACTICE: Default to "without cause" unless clear misconduct
Why? Lower litigation risk, cleaner exit, preserves reputation
```

### 3. The Termination Conversation

**Executive Termination Conversation (30-45 minutes):**

```markdown
# Executive Termination Script

## Pre-Meeting Setup
Location: Private conference room (not exec's office)
Participants:
  - CEO (delivers message)
  - HR Director or General Counsel (witness, legal support)
  - Optional: Board member (for CEO termination)

Timing: Early in week (Monday/Tuesday), mid-morning
Materials:
  - Separation agreement (printed, reviewed by legal)
  - Severance summary (1-page)
  - Return of property checklist
  - IT access revocation plan (coordinate with IT)
  - Security escort (if needed for sensitive exits)

## Conversation Script

Opening (1 min):
CEO: "Thank you for meeting. [HR/Legal], thanks for joining us.
I have difficult news to share. We've made the decision to make a leadership change, and your position is being eliminated effective [date]."

[Pause - let them absorb. Do NOT soften or apologize yet.]

Provide Context (2 min):
"This decision was made after careful consideration with the Board.
[Choose appropriate framing based on exit type]:

Performance-based:
'Despite coaching and support, we haven't seen the progress we need in [specific areas: team performance, delivery, strategy execution]. We believe it's time for new leadership.'

Culture fit:
'We've come to realize there's a mismatch between your leadership style and our company culture. This isn't about performance - it's about fit.'

Restructuring:
'Due to [strategic shift, acquisition, budget constraints], we're eliminating the [role title] position. This is a business decision, not a reflection on your performance.'

This is final - not a negotiation."

Answer Immediate Questions (5 min):
Executive will likely ask:
- "Why now?" → "We believe this is the right time for a transition."
- "Can I stay if I improve?" → "No, this decision is final."
- "Is this performance-related?" → [Be honest but diplomatic]
- "What will you tell people?" → "We'll discuss the communication plan."

[Keep answers brief. Avoid getting drawn into debate.]

Present Severance Package (5 min):
HR/Legal: "Here's your separation agreement. Key terms:

Severance: [X months of base salary, $XXX,XXX total]
Equity: [Vesting treatment - accelerate X months, exercise period extended to X months]
Benefits: [COBRA + company-paid health insurance for X months]
Bonus: [Pro-rated or forfeited, per contract]
Start date: [When severance payments begin]

In exchange, we ask you to:
- Sign a release of claims (no litigation against the company)
- Return all company property
- Maintain confidentiality
- Cooperate with transition (knowledge transfer)
- Non-disparagement (we won't speak negatively about each other)

You have [21-45 days] to review with your attorney before signing."

Logistics & Next Steps (5 min):
"Here's what happens next:

Today:
- Your access to systems will be disabled [now or end of day]
- Please return your laptop, badge, and company property
- [Security escort will accompany you / You can pack your belongings privately]

This week:
- We'll announce the transition internally and externally
- You'll receive the separation agreement via email
- HR will schedule an exit interview (optional)

Communication:
- Internal: We'll announce [agreed message]
- External: We'll issue [press release or no public statement]
- References: I'm willing to provide a [neutral or positive] reference

Questions?"

Close with Respect (2 min):
CEO: "I know this is difficult news. You've contributed to [specific accomplishments].
We appreciate your work and wish you well in your next chapter.
[HR/Legal] will be your main contact for questions going forward."

[Stand, shake hands if appropriate, exit]

## Post-Meeting Actions (Immediate)
□ Notify IT to disable access (email, Slack, systems)
□ Retrieve laptop, badge, company credit card, devices
□ Change passwords for shared accounts
□ Notify executive team (within 1 hour)
□ Prepare internal communication (within 24 hours)
□ Notify Board (if C-level)
□ Secure company property and sensitive files
□ Coordinate with Security (if contentious exit)
```

**Handling Difficult Reactions:**

```
Reaction: Anger / Hostility
"This is bullshit! I've built this company!"

Response:
"I understand you're upset. This is a difficult conversation.
Let's take a moment. [Pause]
The decision is final, but we're committed to a respectful transition."

If escalates:
"I need you to remain professional. If you can't, we'll end this meeting and reconvene tomorrow."

Reaction: Tears / Emotional Breakdown
[Executive breaks down crying]

Response:
"Take your time. [Offer tissue, pause]
I know this is hard. When you're ready, we can discuss next steps."

[Allow time to compose. Don't rush.]

Reaction: Negotiation / Bargaining
"Can I have 90 days to find another role?"
"Can you increase the severance to 12 months?"

Response:
"I understand you'd like more time/money. Let me note your request.
Review the separation agreement with your attorney, and we can discuss any reasonable requests."

[Do NOT agree to anything on the spot. Defer to legal review.]

Reaction: Threats (Legal or Reputational)
"I'm going to sue!" or "I'll go to the press!"

Response:
"I hope we can resolve this amicably. If you choose to pursue legal action, that's your right.
I'm going to end this conversation now and have HR/Legal follow up."

[Immediately notify legal counsel. Document everything.]

Reaction: Denial / Shock
"This can't be happening. There must be a mistake."

Response:
"I know this is surprising. The decision has been carefully considered by [CEO, Board].
It's final. Let's focus on the transition and ensuring you're supported."
```

### 4. Severance Negotiations

**Executive Severance Structure:**

```
Standard Severance Formula:
Base = 1-2 months per year of service (or per contract)
Minimum = 6 months (for executives)
Maximum = 24 months (for CEO, long-tenured C-level)

Typical C-Level Severance Package:

CTO, 3 years of service:
- Base Severance: 12 months salary ($400K)
- Equity: 12 months additional vesting (25% of unvested equity)
- Bonus: Pro-rated target bonus ($100K)
- Benefits: COBRA + 6 months company-paid health insurance
- Outplacement: $15K executive career coaching
- Total Package: ~$515K + equity

VP, 2 years of service:
- Base Severance: 6 months salary ($150K)
- Equity: No acceleration (per contract)
- Bonus: Forfeited (per policy)
- Benefits: COBRA + 3 months insurance
- Total Package: ~$165K

CEO, 5 years of service (Board-level negotiation):
- Base Severance: 18-24 months salary ($600K-$800K)
- Equity: Full acceleration or 50% of unvested (negotiated)
- Bonus: Target or discretionary (negotiated)
- Benefits: COBRA + 12 months insurance
- Consulting agreement: $100K for 6 months (eases transition)
- Total Package: $1M-$3M+ (depending on equity value)
```

**Negotiation Tactics:**

```
Executive's attorney will negotiate for:
- More severance months
- Full equity acceleration
- Longer exercise period (unvested options)
- Positive reference guarantee
- Removal of non-compete
- Consulting agreement (keeps them engaged, reduces litigation risk)

Your negotiation approach:
1. Start with contract terms (baseline)
2. Justify any increases with business rationale
3. Trade-offs (if they want more severance, tighten non-disparagement)
4. Set ceiling (Board-approved maximum)
5. Final offer (take it or leave it)

Example Negotiation:
Exec: "I want 18 months severance instead of 12."
You: "I understand. Let me explain how we arrived at 12: [rationale].
      I can discuss with the Board, but I need you to commit to:
      - 90-day knowledge transfer (consult with new exec)
      - Stronger non-compete (24 months instead of 12)
      - Unconditional release of all claims
      Would you agree to those terms for 18 months?"

Key Principles:
✓ Be fair but firm
✓ Document all negotiations (email confirmations)
✓ Get Board approval for any changes
✓ Don't set precedents (other execs will hear about this)
✗ Never negotiate in the termination meeting (defer to legal review)
```

### 5. Communication Strategy

**Internal Communication (Employees):**

```
Timeline: Announce within 24 hours of termination conversation

Method: CEO email to all employees + All-Hands (if C-level)

Email Template:

---
Subject: Leadership Transition - [Name] Departing

Team,

I want to share an important update. [Name], our [Title], is leaving [Company] effective [date]. We're grateful for [his/her] contributions over the past [X] years, including [specific accomplishment 1] and [specific accomplishment 2].

[Choose appropriate framing]:

Performance/Culture Fit:
"After careful consideration, we've mutually decided that it's time for new leadership in [function]. We wish [Name] well in [his/her] next chapter."

Restructuring:
"As part of our strategic shift to [X], we're making changes to our leadership structure. The [Title] role is being eliminated."

Voluntary:
"[Name] has decided to pursue an exciting opportunity at [Company] / step away to focus on [family, health, other priorities]. We're supportive of [his/her] decision."

Transition Plan:
- Interim leadership: [Name] will serve as interim [Title] while we search for a permanent replacement
- Search timeline: We expect to have a new [Title] in place by [date]
- Day-to-day: No changes to your team or priorities

If you have questions, please reach out to me or [HR/your manager].

Thank you for your continued dedication to [Company].

[CEO Name]

---

All-Hands (for C-level exits):
- 30-minute meeting within 48 hours
- CEO presents transition
- Q&A (scripted answers to anticipated questions)
- Reassure team (stability, no other changes planned)
- Focus on future (search for new leader, exciting roadmap)
```

**External Communication (Press, Investors, Customers):**

```
Public Company: SEC Filing + Press Release (required)

Form 8-K (SEC filing within 4 business days):
- Announce departure of C-level executive
- Effective date
- Reason (if material): "Resigned to pursue other opportunities"
- Separation agreement details (if severance > $XXX)

Press Release (same day as internal announcement):

---
[Company] Announces Leadership Transition

[CITY, DATE] – [Company] today announced that [Name], [Title], is departing the company effective [date].

"We thank [Name] for [his/her] contributions to [Company] over the past [X] years," said [CEO Name], CEO of [Company]. "Under [his/her] leadership, we [specific accomplishment]. We wish [him/her] well in [his/her] future endeavors."

[If applicable]: "[Name] will transition to an advisory role to support the leadership transition."

[Company] has initiated a search for a permanent [Title] and expects to announce an appointment by [quarter/date]. [Interim Name] will serve as interim [Title].

About [Company]:
[Boilerplate]

Contact:
[PR/Investor Relations contact]

---

Private Company: No public statement (unless high-profile exit)

Investor Communication (Board + VCs):
- Private email from CEO to Board and investors
- Explanation of departure (be candid with investors)
- Transition plan and search timeline
- Reassurance (business continuity, no impact on metrics)

Customer Communication (for customer-facing roles like VP Sales, CPO):
- Email from CEO to top customers
- "Leadership transition, no impact on your partnership"
- Introduce interim leader or new account owner
- Reassure continuity of service
```

**Reputation Management (Mutual Non-Disparagement):**

```
Mutual non-disparagement clause (in separation agreement):

"Both parties agree not to make any disparaging or negative statements about the other, whether written or oral, to any third party, including but not limited to employees, customers, investors, press, or social media."

What this means:
- Company cannot badmouth the exec (in references, press, internal comms)
- Exec cannot badmouth the company (on Twitter, LinkedIn, media interviews)

Exceptions:
- Truthful testimony in legal proceedings (if subpoenaed)
- Accurate disclosures required by law (SEC filings)

Enforcement:
- Breach of non-disparagement = loss of remaining severance
- Injunctive relief (court order to stop disparagement)
- Damages (if provable harm)

Best Practices:
✓ Draft neutral language for announcements (avoid "fired", "terminated")
✓ Positive framing when possible ("mutual decision", "pursue other opportunities")
✓ Coordinate LinkedIn posts (exec and company post同时 with agreed language)
✓ CEO provides neutral or positive reference (unless misconduct)
✗ Don't trash the exec publicly (even if tempting)
✗ Don't allow team to gossip or speculate (shut down negativity)
```

### 6. Knowledge Transfer & Transition

**Executive Transition Plan (30-90 days):**

```
Goal: Minimize disruption, transfer critical knowledge, maintain business continuity

Phase 1: Immediate Transition (Week 1)
□ Exec hands over credentials, accounts, systems
□ IT transfers ownership of critical systems
□ Executive's direct reports informed (1-on-1s with CEO/interim)
□ Interim leader appointed (clear authority and responsibilities)
□ Critical projects identified (handoff to interim or other execs)

Phase 2: Knowledge Transfer (Week 2-4)
□ Documentation of processes, decisions, strategy
  - Org structure and key personnel
  - Strategic initiatives and roadmap
  - Key customer/partner relationships
  - Budget and financial commitments
  - Ongoing projects and deadlines
  - Passwords and access (shared docs, contracts)

□ Transition meetings:
  - Exec meets with interim leader (brain dump)
  - Exec meets with key stakeholders (customers, partners, Board)
  - Exec creates written "state of the union" (current state, risks, opportunities)

□ Optional: Consulting agreement
  - Exec remains available for questions (10 hrs/week for 1-3 months)
  - Paid consulting ($5K-$15K/month)
  - Eases transition, reduces risk

Phase 3: Search for Replacement (Month 2-4)
□ Define exec profile (what you learned from previous exec's departure)
□ Engage executive search firm (if C-level)
□ Interim leader maintains stability
□ No major strategic decisions (wait for new exec)

Phase 4: New Exec Onboarding (Month 3-6)
□ Outgoing exec brief new exec (1-2 hour meeting, if amicable)
□ New exec 30-60-90 plan
□ Team rallies around new leadership
```

**Managing the Team After Executive Departure:**

```
Team will have questions and concerns:

Common Reactions:
- Shock / Surprise ("I didn't see this coming!")
- Anxiety ("Is my job safe? What about our team?")
- Gossip ("I heard it was because of [rumor]...")
- Loyalty conflict ("I liked [exec], this feels unfair")
- Opportunity ("Can I step up? Can I apply for the role?")

Your Response (CEO or HR):
1. Transparent communication:
   "I know you're surprised. Here's what I can share: [approved message]
   I can't discuss the details, but I want to address your concerns."

2. Reassure stability:
   "Your jobs are safe. This is a single leadership change, not a restructuring.
   Your priorities and projects remain the same."

3. Shut down gossip:
   "I know there's speculation. Please don't engage in rumors or gossip.
   If you have questions, come directly to me or HR."

4. Define interim leadership:
   "[Interim leader] is in charge. They have full authority to make decisions.
   Please give them your support during this transition."

5. Focus on future:
   "We're searching for an exceptional new [title]. In the meantime, let's focus on [goals, projects, customers]."

6. 1-on-1s with direct reports:
   - Meet individually with exec's former direct reports
   - Address their concerns privately
   - Assess their performance (were they being protected by previous exec?)
   - Clarify reporting structure
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CEO Termination

**Unique Considerations:**

```
Board-Led Process:
- Board Chair or Lead Independent Director leads
- CEO is excluded from Board discussions (conflict of interest)
- Often involves hiring external advisors (legal, PR, search firm)

Decision Process:
- Board executive session (CEO not present)
- Vote to terminate (typically requires majority or supermajority)
- Separation agreement negotiated (often with CEO's attorney)
- Announcement coordinated (SEC filing, press release, employee comm)

Termination Conversation:
- Board Chair delivers message (not interim CEO)
- CEO's attorney often present
- Longer severance negotiations (weeks, not days)

Succession:
- Interim CEO appointed immediately (COO, CFO, or Board member)
- Executive search initiated (3-6 months to find replacement)
- Board heavily involved in search

Communication:
- Board drafts all communications (SEC filing, press release)
- Investor calls (Board Chair addresses investors)
- Employee town hall (Board Chair or interim CEO presents)

High-Profile Risk:
- Press coverage (especially if public company or scandal)
- Stock price impact (can drop 10-30% on CEO departure)
- Talent risk (employees may leave, execs may get poached)
```

### Scenario 2: Misconduct-Based Termination

**Crisis Management Process:**

```
Discovery of Misconduct:
Day 1: Report received (harassment complaint, fraud allegation, etc.)
Day 2-3: Immediate investigation (HR, legal, external investigator)
Day 4-7: Fact-finding (interviews, document review, evidence gathering)
Day 7-10: Decision (terminate, suspend, or exonerate)

Termination for Cause:
- Legal review (ensure "cause" is provable)
- Board approval (for C-level)
- Immediate termination (same day as decision)
- Minimal or no severance ("for cause" = contract forfeiture)
- Equity forfeiture (unvested shares lost)
- Company property retrieved (often with security escort)

Communication (Damage Control):
Internal:
"We recently became aware of [allegations of misconduct] involving [Name], our [Title].
After a thorough investigation, we have terminated [Name]'s employment effective immediately.
We take these matters seriously and have zero tolerance for [harassment, fraud, etc.].
We're committed to a safe and ethical workplace."

External (if public):
"[Company] has terminated [Name], [Title], for violation of company policy.
The matter is under investigation and we are cooperating with authorities [if criminal]."

Legal Risks:
- Defamation (if you wrongly accuse someone of misconduct)
- Retaliation (if exec was whistleblower or filed complaint)
- Criminal liability (if fraud or illegal activity involved)

CRITICAL: Involve legal counsel at every step
```

### Scenario 3: Voluntary Resignation (Exec Leaving for Competitor)

**Managing the Transition:**

```
Executive gives notice: "I'm resigning to join [Competitor]."

Immediate Actions (Day 1):
□ Accept resignation in writing (email confirmation)
□ Determine last day (negotiate: 2 weeks vs 4 weeks vs immediate)
□ Assess risk:
  - Will they recruit your employees?
  - Will they take customers?
  - Do they have access to trade secrets or sensitive IP?
  - Are they subject to non-compete?

Risk Mitigation:
High Risk (competitor in same space):
- Immediate termination (pay out notice period, but revoke access)
- Garden leave (pay them to stay home for 2-4 weeks, no work)
- Enforce non-compete (send cease & desist if they violate)
- Monitor social media and LinkedIn (for employee poaching)

Low Risk (not a competitor):
- Standard 2-4 week transition
- Knowledge transfer to interim
- Positive exit (maintain relationship, possible boomerang hire)

Communication:
Internal: "We support [Name]'s decision to pursue an exciting opportunity. We wish [him/her] well."
External: "After [X] years, [Name] is moving on to new challenges. We thank [him/her] for contributions."

Post-Exit Monitoring:
- Track who follows them to new company (poaching indicator)
- Monitor for trade secret theft or IP violations
- Enforce non-solicit (if they recruit your employees, send legal notice)
```

## Metrics & Post-Mortem

**Executive Turnover Metrics:**

```
Track:
- Voluntary vs involuntary turnover (C-level and VP)
- Average tenure (how long execs stay)
- Regrettable vs non-regrettable attrition
- Time to backfill (how long to replace)
- Cost per executive exit (severance + search + productivity loss)

Benchmarks:
- Healthy: <10% annual executive turnover
- Concerning: 15-25% turnover (leadership instability)
- Crisis: >25% turnover (revolving door)

Executive Exit Post-Mortem (Within 30 days of departure):

Questions to Answer:
1. Why did they leave or why were they terminated?
2. Was this preventable? (Better hiring, coaching, support?)
3. What did we learn about our exec assessment or onboarding?
4. How did the transition go? (Smooth or chaotic?)
5. What would we do differently next time?

Actions:
- Update executive hiring criteria (if bad fit)
- Improve executive onboarding (if new exec struggled)
- Adjust performance feedback cadence (if performance issue wasn't caught early)
- Strengthen Board oversight (if Board wasn't aware of issues)
