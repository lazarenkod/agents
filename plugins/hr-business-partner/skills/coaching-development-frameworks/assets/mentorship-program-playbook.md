---

**Step 3: Matching Algorithm (1 week)**

```markdown
**Matching Process:**

**Automated first pass (if using platform):**
- Match mentee goals ↔ mentor expertise
- Consider working style preferences
- Apply constraints (no reporting line, different orgs)
- Generate preliminary matches

**Manual review and refinement:**

For each proposed match, evaluate:
1. **Goal alignment:** Does mentor have relevant experience для mentee's primary goal?
2. **Expertise fit:** Can mentor provide valuable guidance?
3. **Organizational diversity:** Different teams/orgs? ✅
4. **Working style compatibility:** Reasonable fit (не perfect)
5. **Demographic considerations:**
   - If mentee from underrepresented group, consider mentor с relevant experience
   - Balance между same-background (relatability) и different-background (new perspectives)

**Red flags to avoid:**
🚩 Mentor has no relevant experience для mentee goal
🚩 Working style complete mismatch (e.g., mentee wants direct feedback, mentor very indirect)
🚩 Same immediate team or org
🚩 Mentor overloaded (already has 2+ mentees)
🚩 Geographic/timezone makes scheduling nearly impossible

**Difficult-to-match scenarios:**

If can't find good match:
- [ ] Expand mentor pool (recruit more mentors)
- [ ] Wait for next cohort
- [ ] Suggest alternative (informal mentorship, manager support, training)
- [ ] Place на waitlist

**Finalize matches:**
- Document rationale для каждого match
- Prepare introduction materials
```

- "When I faced something like this..."
- "Let me share another way to think about это..."
- "Have you considered [alternative perspective]?"

Techniques:
✅ Tell stories from your experience
✅ Ask "What would happen if..." questions
✅ Challenge assumptions respectfully
✅ Offer multiple options, не one answer
✅ Connect to broader principles

Avoid:
❌ "Here's what you should do" (directive)
❌ Solving problem for them
❌ Assuming your way is only way
```

**Phase 3: Action Planning (5-10 min)**
```
Help mentee decide next steps:
- "What feels right to try first?"
- "What's smallest step you could take?"
- "What support do you need?"
- "How will you know if it's working?"

Create concrete action items
```

I'm at Senior Engineer level, eligible for promotion к either Staff Engineer (IC) или Engineering Manager. I'm torn.

**Questions:**
1. How did you decide между IC и management?
2. What's actually involved в management day-to-day?
3. Can I switch later if I choose one path?
4. What should I consider в making this decision?

**What I need:**
- Your experience и perspective
- Pros/cons you've observed
- Maybe introduction to someone on each path?
```

**Mentor Approach:**
- Share your decision-making process
- Describe realities of each path (не just titles)
- Help mentee assess их own preferences, strengths, values
- Suggest trial experiences (leading project vs mentoring junior person)
- Offer intro to people на each path for additional perspectives

---

#### Month 2: Building Executive Presence

```markdown
**Topic:** "I want to be taken более seriously в leadership meetings"

**Context:**
I've started attending VP-level meetings as SME. I notice мои ideas often overlooked, или credited к others later. How do I show up with more executive presence?

**Questions:**
1. What is "executive presence" really?
2. How do you command respect в senior meetings?
3. Am I being too junior/technical in my communication?
4. How do you handle being interrupted или dismissed?

**What I need:**
- Feedback на my communication style (если you've observed)
- Techniques вы've used
- Maybe observe you в meeting? Or review recording of my presentation?
```

- Role-play scenarios
- Recommend resources (books, talks)

---

#### Month 3: Navigating Organizational Politics

```markdown

**Specific situation:**
[Describe conflict, stakeholder's concerns, what вы've tried]

**Questions:**
1. How do I influence someone who seems opposed to my work?
2. Am I missing something? Should I understand their perspective better?
3. When do I escalate vs keep trying?
4. How do you handle conflict professionally?

**What I need:**
- Strategy advice
- Maybe introduction или context about this stakeholder?
- Feedback on my approach so far
```

**Mentor Approach:**
- Help mentee see stakeholder's perspective (what are their incentives?)

4. Can you review my promotion packet draft?

**What I need:**
- Reality check: Am I ready, или should I wait?

**Context:**
I'm working 60+ hour weeks. I love my work, но it's not sustainable. I see senior leaders seem to manage — how?

**Questions:**
1. How do you maintain boundaries at senior level?
2. Is working crazy hours just part of being senior?
3. How do you prioritize when everything feels urgent?
4. Am I doing something wrong?

**What I need:**
- Honest talk about reality
- Your strategies
- Permission to set boundaries (если that's okay)
```

**Mentor Approach:**

### Program Coordinator Actions

**Review survey responses (1 week):**

```markdown
**Healthy relationships (80-90% hopefully):**
- ✅ Meeting regularly
- ✅ High satisfaction scores
- ✅ Progress на goals
- ✅ No major issues

**Action:** Send encouragement email:

"Great to hear вашей mentorship going well! Keep up the momentum.
Reminder: You're halfway через program. Consider:
- Have you revisited goals? Any pivots needed?
- Is there deeper topic вы haven't explored yet?
- Don't forget closing ceremony: [Date]"

---

**At-risk relationships (10-15%):**
- ⚠️ Only met once или not at all
- ⚠️ Low satisfaction scores
- ⚠️ Little progress on goals
- ⚠️ Scheduling challenges
- ⚠️ One party not engaged

**Action:** Reach out proactively:

"I noticed [concern] from your mid-point survey. I'd love to chat about how we can help.
Would you have 15 min для quick call this week?"

**In call:**
- Understand root issue
- Is it fixable? (e.g., scheduling → different meeting cadence)
- Does relationship need reset conversation?
- Provide coaching или resources
- Set up check-in в 3-4 weeks

---

**Failed relationships (rare, <5%):**
- 🔴 Haven't met или only once
- 🔴 Poor satisfaction
- 🔴 Personality mismatch
- 🔴 One party wants out

**Action:** Have honest conversation

"It seems this match isn't working. That happens sometimes — не reflection на either of you.

Options:
1. **Facilitated reset conversation:** I can help вас discuss what's not working и see if fixable
2. **Pause for now:** Take a break, revisit in Month 4-5 if both want
3. **Rematch:** Find new partner for remainder (if timing/pool allows)
4. **Exit program:** Perfectly okay — better to acknowledge than force it

What feels right?"

Be supportive, not judgmental. Learn from what went wrong для future matching.
