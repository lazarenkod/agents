- Mentorship program design
- Leadership development programs
- Coaching managers to become better coaches
- Succession planning conversations
- Difficult performance conversations

## Базовые концепции

### 1. GROW Coaching Model (John Whitmore)

**GROW = Goal, Reality, Options, Will**

Самый популярный coaching framework в мире, используется в Google, Microsoft, AWS.

**G - Goal (Цель)**
```
Вопросы для определения цели:
- "Чего вы хотите достичь?"
- "Как бы выглядел успех?"
- "Что изменится, когда вы достигнете этой цели?"
- "Почему эта цель важна для вас?"
- "Как эта цель связана с вашими долгосрочными карьерными целями?"

SMART Criteria:
- Specific (конкретная)
- Measurable (измеримая)
- Achievable (достижимая)
- Relevant (релевантная)
- Time-bound (ограниченная по времени)

Example:
"Стать Senior Engineer в течение 12 месяцев, продемонстрировав leadership в системном дизайне и менторстве 2 junior engineers"
```

**R - Reality (Реальность)**
```
Вопросы для оценки текущей ситуации:
- "Где вы сейчас находитесь относительно этой цели?"
- "Что вы уже пробовали?"
- "Что работает? Что не работает?"
- "Какие препятствия стоят на пути?"
- "Какие ресурсы у вас есть?"
- "Какая поддержка вам нужна?"

Оценка gap analysis:
Current state: L4 Software Engineer, 3 years experience
Desired state: L5 Senior Engineer
Gap: System design expertise, team leadership, cross-functional collaboration
```

**O - Options (Варианты)**
```
Вопросы для генерации вариантов действий:
- "Какие варианты у вас есть?"
- "Что еще вы могли бы сделать?"
- "Если бы не было ограничений, что бы вы попробовали?"
- "Что бы сделал человек, которого вы уважаете, в этой ситуации?"
- "Какие подходы вы еще не рассматривали?"

Brainstorming (без критики):
Option 1: Lead design review for team's next major project
Option 2: Shadow Staff Engineer for 3 months (learn by observation)
Option 3: Take online course on distributed systems (Coursera, MIT 6.824)
Option 4: Present at team Tech Talk once per month
Option 5: Mentor 2 junior engineers (develop coaching skills)
Option 6: Contribute to open-source distributed systems project
```

**W - Will / Way Forward (Путь вперед)**
```
Вопросы для commitment и action plan:
- "Какой вариант вы выберете?"
- "Какие конкретные шаги вы предпримете?"
- "Когда вы начнете?"
- "Как вы будете отслеживать прогресс?"
- "Какая поддержка вам нужна от меня?"
- "Что может помешать? Как вы с этим справитесь?"
- "По шкале от 1 до 10, насколько вы уверены, что сделаете это?"

Action Plan:
Week 1-2: Enroll in MIT 6.824 distributed systems course (online)
Week 3: Volunteer to lead design for team's new caching layer project
Week 4: Request mentorship assignment for 2 junior engineers
Ongoing: Tech Talk presentations (monthly), shadow Staff Engineer (3 hrs/week)
Check-in: Weekly 1-on-1s to discuss progress and blockers
```

**Example GROW Conversation:**
```
Manager: "Let's use our 1-on-1 today to discuss your career goals. Where would you like to be in 12 months?"
Employee: "I want to become a Senior Engineer."

[G - Goal]
Manager: "Great goal. What would 'Senior Engineer' mean to you? What would be different?"
Employee: "I'd be leading technical decisions, mentoring others, and working on complex systems."
Manager: "How does that align with your long-term career aspirations?"
Employee: "I want to eventually become a Staff Engineer and tech lead. Senior is the next step."

[R - Reality]
Manager: "Where are you now relative to that goal? What are your current strengths?"
Employee: "I'm strong in coding and delivering projects, but I haven't led system designs or mentored yet."
Manager: "What's holding you back from those activities?"
Employee: "I'm not sure I'm ready. I don't want to mess up or look incompetent."

[O - Options]
Manager: "That's a common concern. What could you do to build confidence in those areas?"
Employee: "I could shadow senior engineers, take courses, or volunteer for smaller leadership opportunities."
Manager: "Those are great options. What else?"
Employee: "I could ask for mentorship, pair with others, or present my work to get feedback."
Manager: "Which of these feels most impactful to you?"

[W - Will]
Employee: "I think leading a smaller project and getting a mentor would help most."
Manager: "Perfect. What specific steps will you take this week?"
Employee: "I'll volunteer to lead the caching layer design and ask you to assign me a mentor."
Manager: "Great. I'll pair you with Sarah as a mentor. Let's check in weekly on your progress. Sound good?"
Employee: "Yes, thank you!"
```

### 2. Career Conversations (Google - Project Oxygen)

**Google's Research on Manager Effectiveness:**
- "Supports career development and discusses performance" = #6 behavior of great managers

**Career Conversation Framework (Quarterly):**
```
1. Career Aspirations (10 min):
   "Where do you want to be in 1 year? 3 years? 5 years?"
   "What role excites you? IC or management track?"
   "What motivates you? Impact, learning, leadership, compensation?"

2. Strengths Assessment (10 min):
   "What are you naturally great at?"
   "What energizes you at work?"
   "What do others come to you for?"

3. Development Areas (10 min):
   "What skills do you want to develop?"
   "What's holding you back from your goals?"
   "Where do you feel least confident?"

4. Opportunities (15 min):
   "What projects or roles align with your goals?"
   "Who could you learn from (mentors, shadowing)?"
   "What stretch assignments could help?"

5. Action Plan (15 min):
   "What will you commit to doing?"
   "What support do you need from me?"
   "How will we track progress?"
   "When should we revisit this plan?"
```

**Example Career Conversation:**
```
Manager: "Let's talk about your career. If we fast forward 3 years, where do you want to be?"
Employee: "I'd love to be a Product Manager, working on ML products."

Manager: "Interesting! What draws you to PM?"
Employee: "I love the customer side and strategic thinking, not just coding."

Manager: "That's insightful. You've shown strong product thinking on our recent projects. What skills do you need to build?"
Employee: "Product strategy, user research, stakeholder management."

Manager: "Great self-awareness. Here's what I can offer:
- Shadow our PM Sarah for 2 hours/week (learn the role)
- Lead product spec for next feature (practice writing PRDs)
- Present at Product Review (get exposure to leadership)
- Connect you with PM in another team (mentorship)

What sounds most valuable?"
Employee: "All of it! Can we start with shadowing Sarah?"

Manager: "Absolutely. I'll intro you this week. Let's check in monthly on your PM skill development."
```

### 3. Microsoft Model-Coach-Care Framework

**Satya Nadella's Leadership Philosophy:**
"Great managers **Model** the way, **Coach** their teams, and **Care** about people."

**Model (Show by Example)**
```
Actions speak louder than words:
- Work-life balance: If you want team to unplug, you unplug visibly
- Growth mindset: Share your failures and learnings publicly
- Collaboration: Model cross-functional partnering
- Customer obsession: Regularly share customer feedback and insights
- Continuous learning: Take courses, read books, share knowledge

Example:
Manager takes online course on AI → Shares learnings in team meeting → Encourages team to learn
Result: Team sees learning as valued, enrolls in courses themselves
```

**Coach (Develop People)**
```
Coaching behaviors:
- Ask questions instead of giving answers (Socratic method)
- Provide growth opportunities (stretch assignments)
- Give real-time feedback (don't save for reviews)
- Celebrate progress and effort (not just outcomes)
- Make time for development (1-on-1s are sacred)

Example:
Junior engineer asks: "Should I use SQL or NoSQL for this feature?"
Bad manager: "Use Postgres." (directive, no learning)
Good coach: "What are the trade-offs? What's your recommendation?" (develops thinking)
```

**Care (Show Genuine Interest)**
```
Caring behaviors:
- Personal check-ins: "How are you doing?" (not just work)
- Flex for life events: Family emergency → "Take the time you need"
- Advocate for team: Fight for promotions, raises, resources
- Psychological safety: "Mistakes are learning opportunities"
- Recognition: Public praise, written thank-yous, celebration

Example:
Employee's parent is ill → Manager: "Take whatever time you need. We'll cover your work. Family first."
Result: Employee feels cared for, loyalty increases, engagement improves
```

### 4. Skip-Level Meetings (Executive Feedback)

**Purpose**: Senior leaders connect directly with ICs/lower-level managers for unfiltered feedback and mentorship.

**Amazon Skip-Level Practice:**
```
Frequency: Quarterly or semi-annually
Duration: 30-45 minutes
Participants: VP/Director + IC (without their manager)

Structure:
1. Opening (5 min): "This is a safe space. Anything you share stays confidential (unless illegal/unethical)."

2. Feedback on Organization (15 min):
   "What's working well in the team/org?"
   "What's not working?"
   "What should we start/stop/continue doing?"
   "Is there anything blocking your productivity?"

3. Career Development (15 min):
   "What are your career goals?"
   "How can leadership support your growth?"
   "Are there projects or opportunities you're interested in?"

4. Culture & Manager Feedback (10 min):
   "How's your relationship with your manager?"
   "Do you feel psychologically safe?"
   "What could your manager do better?"

5. Closing (5 min):
   "Is there anything else you'd like leadership to know?"
   "Thank you for the honest feedback."
```

**What Leaders Learn from Skip-Levels:**
- Ground truth on team morale (not filtered by managers)
- Process blockers and friction points
- Manager effectiveness (coaching, development, culture)
- Early warning signs (attrition risk, burnout, disengagement)
- High-potential talent (ICs worth investing in)

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Address systemic issues raised by multiple ICs
- Coach managers on improvement areas
- Connect high-potential ICs with growth opportunities
- Report back to ICs on actions taken (close the loop)

### 5. Mentorship Programs

**Stripe Mentorship Program:**
```
Structure: Formal 6-month mentorship program

Pairing:
- Mentee requests mentor (or HR matches)

   - Adjust readiness assessments
   - Update succession slate
```

**Succession Conversation Template:**
```
Manager: "I'd like to discuss your readiness for {role}. Interested in that path?"
Employee: "Yes, definitely interested."

Manager: "Great. Here's where I see you today:
- Strengths: {List strengths relevant to target role}
- Gaps: {List development needs}
- Readiness: {Ready Now / Soon / Later}

To close the gaps, here's what I recommend:
1. {Development activity 1}
2. {Development activity 2}
3. {Development activity 3}

If you execute on this plan, you'd be ready in {timeframe}. Does that align with your goals?"

Employee: "Yes, that makes sense. Let's do it."

Manager: "Perfect. I'll check in quarterly on your progress. Let's also talk about potential timeline for when the role might open up."
```

## Практические Сценарии

### Scenario 1: Employee Wants Promotion

**Situation**: Employee asks, "When will I be promoted?"

**Coaching Approach:**
```
1. Acknowledge & Explore (5 min):
   "I'm glad you're thinking about growth. What's driving your interest in promotion right now?"
   (Listen for: career progression, compensation, recognition, new challenges)

2. Assess Readiness (10 min):
   "Let's look at the Senior Engineer criteria. Where do you stand on each?"
   - Technical expertise: "You're strong here (4/5)"
   - System design: "Developing, need more practice (3/5)"
   - Mentorship: "Haven't demonstrated yet (2/5)"
   - Cross-functional collaboration: "Strong (4/5)"

3. Gap Analysis (10 min):
   "Based on this, you're at 65% readiness. Promotions typically happen at 80-90%."
   "The main gaps are system design and mentorship. Agree?"

4. Development Plan (15 min):
   "Here's how to close the gaps:
   - System design: Lead design for Project X (next quarter)
   - Mentorship: Take on 2 junior engineers as mentees (starting next month)
   - Timeline: If you demonstrate these by Q3, we can discuss promotion then"

5. Commit & Support (5 min):
   "What do you think? Does this feel achievable?"
   "What support do you need from me?"
   "Let's check in biweekly on your progress."
```

### Scenario 2: Career Change (IC to Manager)

**Situation**: IC wants to become a people manager.

**Coaching Approach:**
```
1. Understand Motivation (10 min):
   "What attracts you to management?"
   Good reasons: Developing people, strategic thinking, broader impact
   Bad reasons: "Only way to advance", "Get paid more", "Tired of coding"

2. Reality Check (15 min):
   "Let me share what management actually looks like:
   - 60% time on people (1-on-1s, performance, hiring, conflicts)
   - 20% time on strategy (planning, stakeholder management)
   - 20% time on execution (hands-on work decreases significantly)
   - Less coding, more meetings, more difficult conversations

   Does that still excite you?"

3. Test the Waters (10 min):
   "Before committing, let's test your interest:
   - Shadow me in 1-on-1s for a month (see what it's really like)
   - Mentor 2 junior engineers (practice people development)
   - Lead hiring for next engineer (learn interviewing, debriefs)
   - Read 'The Manager's Path' by Camille Fournier

   After 3 months, let's revisit. Still want to manage?"

4. Development Path (10 min):
   "If yes, here's the path to manager:
   - Demonstrate team leadership (lead projects, influence others)
   - Build coaching skills (mentor, give feedback, develop people)
   - Understand business (strategy, budgets, planning)
   - Timeline: 6-12 months to build these skills, then first opening"
```

### Scenario 3: Disengaged Employee

**Situation**: High performer seems disengaged lately.

**Coaching Approach:**
```
1. Open with Care (5 min):
   "I've noticed you seem less energized lately. Is everything okay?"
   (Listen for: burnout, personal issues, boredom, career concerns, team dynamics)

2. Understand Root Cause (15 min):
   "What's changed for you?"
   "What would make work more fulfilling?"
   "Is there something I'm doing (or not doing) that's affecting your motivation?"

3. Co-Create Solutions (20 min):
   Based on root cause:
   - Burnout: Redistribute workload, time off, workload boundaries
   - Boredom: New challenges, stretch projects, learning opportunities
   - Career: Promotion path, new role, skill development
   - Team: Address conflicts, change project/team if needed
   - Manager: Adjust management style, more/less support

4. Action Plan (5 min):
   "Here's what we'll do:
   - {Action 1 from manager}
   - {Action 2 from employee}
   - {Timeline and check-in plan}

   If we address these, how would you feel?"

5. Follow-up (Ongoing):
   Check in weekly for 4-6 weeks to ensure improvement
   If no improvement, consider transfer or mutual exit conversation
```
