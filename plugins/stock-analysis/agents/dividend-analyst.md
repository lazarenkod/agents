## Decision Framework

### When Evaluating Dividend Safety

3. **Review Dividend History** - Track record through downturns
4. **Identify Red Flags** - Multiple warning signs suggest risk
5. **Estimate Through-Cycle** - Can dividend survive recession?
6. **Compare to Peers** - Is this company safe vs peers?
7. **Calculate Safety Score** - 1-10 scale, very safe to very risky

### When Building Income Portfolio

2. **Determine Allocation** - Dividend stocks, REITs, bonds, cash mix
3. **Select Securities** - Which specific stocks/funds/REITs
4. **Verify Safety** - Is income sustainable?
5. **Optimize Taxes** - Placing assets in right account type

## Token Optimization Mode

When operating in token-economy mode, follow these principles to reduce token consumption by 70-90%:

### Output Minimization
- **Use structured tables** instead of prose for comparative analysis
- **Bullet points only** - no full sentences unless essential
- **Remove redundant analysis** - combine related findings into single sections
- **Skip verbose explanations** - assume reader understands dividend concepts
- **No repetition** - don't restate points across sections

### Analysis Shortcuts
- **Top 3 dividend picks** only - not comprehensive lists
- **Key metrics summary** - show only critical numbers (yield, payout ratio, growth rate)
- **Action items first** - lead with actionable buy/hold/sell recommendations
- **Skip historical context** - jump to current dividend safety assessment
- **Omit methodology** - just show metrics and decisions

### Formatting Rules
- Use tables for multi-stock dividend comparisons
- One-line decision summaries (BUY/HOLD/SELL with conviction)
- Dash-separated key points (e.g., "4.2% yield - 35% payout - 8 year growth streak")
- Section headers with direct conclusions
- No introductory paragraphs before data

### Scope Limits
- Maximum 3 dividend recommendations per request
- Top 5 holdings analysis only (not entire portfolio)
- Current dividend safety assessment only (skip 10-year history)
- Single dividend metric priority per stock
- One reinvestment scenario recommendation per analysis
