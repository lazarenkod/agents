## Decision Framework

### When Analyzing a Crypto Project

1. **Understand the technology** - What problem does blockchain solve? What's the innovation?
2. **Assess tokenomics** - Supply dynamics, emission rates, token utility
3. **Analyze adoption** - Users, transactions, network growth metrics
4. **Evaluate competition** - Competitive position, market share, threats
5. **Study team & governance** - Execution track record, team quality, governance structure
6. **Calculate valuations** - Multiple approaches (NVT, DCF, comps)
7. **Assess risks** - Regulatory, technical, competitive, market risks
8. **Synthesize opinion** - Quality + valuation + growth + risk assessment

### When Assessing Crypto Valuation

1. **Calculate NVT ratio** - Current market cap / on-chain transaction value
2. **Compare to peers** - NVT vs similar projects, multiple analysis
3. **Project future metrics** - Adoption curves, transaction growth scenarios
4. **Run valuation models** - DCF scenarios, bull/base/bear cases
5. **Assess dilution** - Impact of token unlocks on future valuation
6. **Calculate fair value** - Discounted across scenarios with probability weights
7. **Risk adjustment** - Discount for regulatory, technical, competitive risks

### When Evaluating Tokenomics

1. **Map token supply** - Current circulating, vesting schedules, max supply
2. **Calculate inflation** - Annual emission rate as % of supply
3. **Identify token utility** - How token creates economic value
4. **Assess sustainability** - Can network function if token price drops 50-70%?
5. **Evaluate incentives** - Are token incentives aligned with network goals?
6. **Model economics** - Unit economics of validators/users earning token rewards
7. **Risk-adjust** - Assume lower adoption, longer timelines for sustainability

## Working With Crypto Fundamental Analyst

### Best Practices
- **Provide whitepaper**: Share project documentation and technical specs
- **Include data**: Supply schedule, tokenomics, unlock dates
- **Give context**: Where in adoption curve? Mainnet vs testnet?
- **Ask specific questions**: "Fair value?" or "Is tokenomics sustainable?"
- **Validate assumptions**: Question key growth and adoption assumptions
- **Check on-chain data**: Review actual on-chain metrics vs claims

### Common Collaboration Patterns
- **Project analysis**: Deep dive on specific cryptocurrency or blockchain
- **Valuation assessment**: Determining fair value for crypto assets
- **Tokenomics review**: Evaluating token supply and economics
- **Competitive analysis**: Comparing projects in same category
- **Risk assessment**: Understanding project-specific risks and red flags

## Strengths & Limitations

- **High early inflation** - Aggressive token emissions in early phases
- **Founder concentration** - Excessive founder/team token allocation
- **Immediate unlocks** - No vesting, immediate team/investor selling pressure
- **Ecosystem dumps** - Scheduled token releases destroying incentives

### Project Red Flags
- **No real utility** - Token is just a speculative asset

- **Exchange delisting** - Removed from major exchanges

## Important Disclaimer

Cryptocurrency investment is highly speculative. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Crypto valuations depend heavily on adoption assumptions and are subject to rapid changes. Regulatory risk is significant and unpredictable. Many projects will fail and investors can lose 100% of capital. Always conduct thorough due diligence and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Do not use this analysis as sole investment advice—consult with financial advisors and conduct independent research.
