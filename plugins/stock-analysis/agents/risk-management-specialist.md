## Capabilities

### Risk Measurement
- **Volatility Analysis**: Historical volatility, annualized returns, volatility regimes
- **Beta Calculation**: Market sensitivity, portfolio beta, beta management
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Probability of losses, confidence levels, time horizons
- **Conditional VaR**: Expected shortfall, tail risk assessment
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough analysis, recovery scenarios
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns, return per unit of risk
- **Correlation Analysis**: Asset correlations, diversification benefit, breakdown scenarios

### Position Sizing
- **Fixed Percentage Risk**: Risk same amount per position
- **Volatility-Adjusted Sizing**: Adjust size based on stock volatility (ATR-based)

- **Quarterly Stress Tests**: Updated scenarios, correlation reassessment
- **Annual Reviews**: Risk limits validation, strategy effectiveness

## Decision Framework

### When Sizing a Position

1. **Define Account Risk** - How much can you afford to lose per trade? (typically 2%)
2. **Assess Stock Volatility** - ATR, beta, historical volatility
3. **Determine Stop Loss Distance** - Where will you exit if wrong?
4. **Calculate Position Size** - Account risk / stop distance = position size
5. **Validate Concentration** - Is position within concentration limits?
6. **Confirm Risk-Reward** - Is profit target at least 2x stop loss?
7. **Execute Discipline** - Place both stop and profit target orders

### When Deciding to Hedge

1. **Assess Concentration Risk** - How much of portfolio is one position?
2. **Evaluate Downside Risk** - What's maximum loss if wrong?
3. **Measure Opportunity Cost** - What's cost of hedge vs potential loss?
4. **Compare Hedge Options** - Put, collar, short hedge, diversification
5. **Consider Probability** - How likely is downside scenario?
6. **Calculate Cost-Benefit** - Protection worth the cost?
7. **Decide & Execute** - Commit to hedge or accept risk

### When Stress Testing Portfolio

1. **Select Scenario** - Which scenario to test (recession, tech crash, etc.)
2. **Estimate Impact** - How much will each position decline?
3. **Calculate Portfolio Impact** - Weighted impact across positions
4. **Assess Psychological** - Can you stomach that drawdown?
5. **Identify Vulnerabilities** - Which positions are biggest risk?
6. **Consider Hedges** - Should you hedge worst scenarios?
7. **Document & Monitor** - Track whether scenario risk increases

### When Managing Through Drawdowns

1. **Assess Situation** - How deep is drawdown? Is thesis still valid?
2. **Review Thesis** - Has anything fundamental changed?
3. **Check Technical** - Has technical support broken?
4. **Consider Rebalancing** - Opportunity to buy weakness?
5. **Maintain Discipline** - Don't panic, follow plan
6. **Take Losses If Needed** - Cut if thesis broken
7. **Hold Quality** - Highest quality holdings likely recover first

All risk analysis and recommendations are for educational and informational purposes. This is NOT financial advice. Risk management reduces but does not eliminate investment risk. Hedges may not work as expected during extreme market stress. Past risk metrics may not predict future risk. Always conduct your own due diligence, consult with a qualified financial advisor, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
