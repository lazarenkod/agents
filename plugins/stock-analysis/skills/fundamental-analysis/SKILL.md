## Core Concepts

### 1. Income Statement Analysis

**Revenue Quality**
Higher quality revenue = more sustainable profits

**Revenue Assessment:**
- **Growth rate** - Is revenue growing faster than industry?
- **Diversification** - Multiple revenue streams reduce risk
- **Customer concentration** - Few large customers = risk
- **Recurring revenue** - Subscription models = more predictable
- **Organic growth** - Growth from operations vs acquisitions

**Gross Margin Analysis**

Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue

- **Higher margins** - Better pricing power, cost efficiency
- **Trending margins** - Improving = quality improving
- **Margin compression** - Declining = competitive pressure
- **Peer comparison** - Margins vs competitors indicate efficiency
- **Margin expansion** - Scale benefits or pricing power

**Example:**
```
Company A: 45% gross margin (high-value products)
Company B: 25% gross margin (commodity products)
Company A has better pricing power and quality
```

**Operating Margin Analysis**

Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue

- **Operating leverage** - Margins expand as revenue grows
- **Operating efficiency** - Can company convert revenue to profit?
- **SG&A spending** - Selling, General, Administrative efficiency
- **R&D intensity** - How much invested in innovation?

**Net Margin Analysis**

Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue

- **Bottom line profitability** - After all expenses
- **Tax rate** - Effective tax rate impact
- **One-time items** - Non-recurring charges affecting net income
- **Quality of earnings** - How much is from core operations?

### 2. Balance Sheet Analysis

**Asset Quality**

**Current Assets:**
- **Cash** - Liquidity and financial flexibility
- **Accounts receivable** - Can company collect from customers?
- **Inventory** - Is inventory turning over properly?

**Fixed Assets:**
- **Property, plant & equipment** - Capital intensive business?
- **Goodwill** - Intangible assets from acquisitions
- **Capitalized software** - Tech company asset base

**Liquidity Metrics**

**Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Ideal: 1.5 to 3.0
- Below 1.0: Can't cover short-term obligations
- Above 3.0: Possibly inefficient use of cash

**Quick Ratio** = (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities
- More stringent than current ratio
- Excludes inventory (harder to convert to cash)
- Ideal: 1.0 or higher

**Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- Positive = Good financial health
- Negative = May struggle with obligations
- Trend = Should be stable or improving

**Debt Analysis**

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio** = Total Debt / Total Equity
- High ratio = More financial risk
- Industry dependent (utilities higher, tech lower)
- Trend = Increasing ratio = more leverage

**Debt-to-EBITDA** = Total Debt / EBITDA
- How many years of EBITDA needed to pay debt?
- Ideal: < 2.0x for stable companies
- 2-3x: Moderate leverage
- >3x: High leverage, refinancing risk

**Interest Coverage Ratio** = EBIT / Interest Expense
- Can company pay interest on debt?
- Ideal: > 3.0x
- < 1.5x: Risky, may struggle with payments

**Equity Analysis**

**Book Value** = Assets - Liabilities
- Accounting value of company
- Quality depends on asset quality
- Book value per share = Book value / shares outstanding

**Return on Equity (ROE)** = Net Income / Equity
- How efficiently does company generate returns?
- Higher ROE = Better capital efficiency
- Compare to cost of equity (should exceed)
- Example: 15% ROE = Good, 5% ROE = Poor

### 3. Cash Flow Analysis

**Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**
Cash generated from core business operations

**Quality Assessment:**
- **OCF > Net Income** - Earnings are high quality
- **OCF < Net Income** - Earnings quality concerns (accruals)
- **Consistent OCF** - Predictable, reliable business
- **Growing OCF** - Business generating increasing cash
- **OCF Margin** - OCF / Revenue (should be > net margin if quality)

**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
Cash available after capital expenditures

**FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures**

**Analysis:**
- **Positive FCF** - Company generating excess cash
- **Growing FCF** - Increasingly cash generative
- **FCF Yield** - FCF per share / Stock price (high = undervalued)
- **FCF to Debt** - Can pay down debt with cash generation

**Example:**
```
Company Financial Summary:
Net Income: $100M
Operating Cash Flow: $120M ✓ (higher quality)
CapEx: $20M
Free Cash Flow: $100M

Great financial position:
- Generating more cash than accounting profit
- Plenty of FCF after maintaining operations
- Could pay dividends, buy back shares, reduce debt
```

**Cash Flow vs Earnings**
Always prefer companies with growing cash flow:

```
Quality Ranking:
1. Growing earnings + Growing FCF ✓✓✓ (Best)
2. Growing earnings + Flat FCF ✓✓ (Good but watch)
3. Flat earnings + Growing FCF ✓✓ (Restructuring)
4. Declining earnings + Declining FCF ✗✗✗ (Worst)
```

### 4. Valuation Methods

**Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**

P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

**Interpretation:**
- **Low P/E** - Potentially undervalued (or cheap for reason)
- **High P/E** - Potentially overvalued (or expensive for reason)
- **P/E < 15** - Often considered undervalued
- **P/E 15-25** - Fair value range
- **P/E > 25** - Often considered overvalued

**Forward P/E** - Based on future earnings (more useful)
**Historical P/E** - Based on past earnings (backward-looking)

**PEG Ratio** = P/E Ratio / Earnings Growth Rate

- Adjusts P/E for growth expectations
- PEG < 1.0: Stock cheap relative to growth
- PEG 1.0-2.0: Fairly valued
- PEG > 2.0: Stock expensive relative to growth

**Example:**
```
Stock A: P/E 20, Growing 15% per year → PEG = 20/15 = 1.33 (Fair)
Stock B: P/E 30, Growing 40% per year → PEG = 30/40 = 0.75 (Cheap!)
Stock B is better deal despite higher P/E
```

**Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)**

P/B = Market Cap / Book Value

- **P/B < 1.0** - Trading below book value (potentially undervalued)
- **P/B 1-3** - Normal range
- **P/B > 3** - Trading at premium (investors expect growth)
- **Asset-heavy business** - Pays to look at P/B
- **High-margin business** - P/B less meaningful

**Enterprise Value / EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)**

Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash

EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA

- **EV/EBITDA < 10x** - Often undervalued
- **EV/EBITDA 10-15x** - Fair value
- **EV/EBITDA > 15x** - Often overvalued
- **Compares apples to apples** - Debt/cash structure neutral
- **Better than P/E** - Uses operating profit, not net income

**Dividend Yield**

Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Stock Price

- **Yield < 2%** - Growth focused, lower income
- **Yield 2-4%** - Balanced income and growth
- **Yield > 4%** - Income focused (check sustainability)
- **Rising yield** - Either dividend increase or stock decline
- **Covered payout ratio** - Earnings cover dividend (check FCF)

**Payout Ratio** = Dividends / Net Income

- **< 30%** - Safe, room for growth
- **30-50%** - Sustainable, good coverage
- **> 50%** - Higher risk, less room for safety

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**

Intrinsic Value = PV of future free cash flows + Terminal Value

**Steps:**
1. Project free cash flows (5-10 years)
2. Calculate terminal value (perpetuity growth)
3. Discount to present value (discount rate = WACC)
4. Compare to current price

**DCF Valuation Outcome:**
- **Intrinsic Value > Price** - Stock undervalued (buy)
- **Intrinsic Value = Price** - Stock fairly valued (hold)
- **Intrinsic Value < Price** - Stock overvalued (sell)

**Example:**
```
Company FCF Projection:
Year 1: $10M
Year 2: $11M
Year 3: $12.1M
...
Terminal Value (Year 5+): $150M

Present Value of FCF: $50M
PV of Terminal Value: $80M
Total Enterprise Value: $130M
Less: Net Debt: $20M
Equity Value: $110M
Per Share (10M shares): $11/share

If current price $8/share → Undervalued
If current price $15/share → Overvalued
```

### 5. Earnings Analysis

**Earnings Quality**

**High Quality Earnings:**
- Growing faster than revenue (margin expansion)
- Supported by cash flow
- Recurring and sustainable
- From core operations, not one-time items
- Conservative accounting (not aggressive)

**Low Quality Earnings:**
- Declining operating margins
- Revenue growing but cash flow declining
- Heavy one-time items
- Accounting manipulations
- Non-recurring revenue sources

**Earnings Surprises**

**Positive Surprise** (Actual > Forecast)
- Beat expectations = Momentum boost
- Management credibility increases
- Stock often rallies post-earnings

**Negative Surprise** (Actual < Forecast)
- Miss expectations = Momentum break
- Management credibility declines
- Stock often selloffs post-earnings

**Estimate Revisions**
More important than beats/misses

- **Analyst upgrading estimates** - Bullish signal
- **Analyst downgrading estimates** - Bearish signal
- **Raising full-year guidance** - Management confident
- **Lowering full-year guidance** - Caution ahead

### 6. Competitive Positioning

**Moat Analysis**
Sustainable competitive advantages

**Types of Moats:**
- **Brand strength** - Customers prefer brand (Apple, Nike)
- **Cost advantage** - Can produce cheaper (Costco, Walmart)
- **Switching costs** - Expensive to switch (software, healthcare)
- **Network effects** - More valuable with more users (Facebook, Visa)
- **Proprietary technology** - Patent protection, exclusive tech
- **Scale advantages** - Larger = cheaper (Amazon)

**Competitive Position Assessment:**
- **Strong moat** - Sustainable competitive advantage
- **Weak moat** - Commodity industry, high competition
- **Widening moat** - Improving competitive position
- **Narrowing moat** - Losing competitive advantage

**Industry Dynamics**

**Attractive Industries:**
- Consolidating (fewer, stronger competitors)
- Pricing power (can raise prices without losing customers)
- Growing demand (tailwinds, not headwinds)
- High barriers to entry (hard for new competitors)
- Few substitutes (durable products)

**Unattractive Industries:**
- Fragmented (many competitors, price pressure)
- Commoditized (price-taking, no differentiation)
- Declining demand (secular headwinds)
- Low barriers (easy for new entrants)
- Multiple substitutes (customer alternatives)

### 7. Management Quality

**Capital Allocation Track Record**
How well does management deploy capital?

**Quality Indicators:**
- **Acquisitions** - Have they been accretive or dilutive?
- **Buybacks** - Buying back low or high (cheap or expensive)?
- **Dividend** - Conservative or aggressive?
- **Debt/Equity** - Maintaining healthy balance sheet?
- **R&D spending** - Investing in future growth?

**Insider Trading Activity**
What do insiders know?

**Bullish Signals:**
- Insiders buying shares (skin in game)
- CEO buying significant amounts
- No insider sales

**Bearish Signals:**
- Heavy insider selling
- Directors selling
- No buying activity

**Compensation Structure**
Incentive alignment

**Good Structure:**
- Salary + bonus + stock options (aligns with shareholders)
- Long vesting period (focuses on long-term)
- Meaningful holdings (skin in game)

**Poor Structure:**
- Heavy upfront bonuses (short-term focus)
- Golden parachutes (not aligned)
- Excessive compensation (shareholder dilution)

### 8. Risk Factors

**Financial Risk**
- High debt loads
- Low liquidity
- Deteriorating balance sheet

**Operational Risk**
- Key customer concentration
- Key person risk
- Supply chain vulnerability

**Industry Risk**
- Disruption potential
