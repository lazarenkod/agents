## Core Concepts

### 1. Interest Rates & Monetary Policy

**Federal Funds Rate**
The rate banks lend to each other overnight. Affects all other interest rates in the economy.

```
Fed Funds Rate Impact:
↑ Rate increases (tightening)
├─ Higher borrowing costs for companies
├─ Higher mortgage rates
├─ Lower bond prices (inverse relationship)
├─ Slower economic growth
├─ Lower stock valuations (higher discount rates)
└─ Good for: Banks, savers

↓ Rate decreases (easing)
├─ Lower borrowing costs
├─ Lower mortgage rates
├─ Higher bond prices
├─ Faster economic growth
├─ Higher stock valuations
└─ Good for: Borrowers, growth stocks
```

**Key Rate Levels**
```
Fed Funds Target: 4.75%-5.00% (example)

Discount Rate on Stocks Impact:
- Cost of Capital increases with rates
- Stock valuations decline (higher discount rate)
- Formula: Valuation = Future Cash Flow / Discount Rate
- When rates up 1%, valuations down 5-10%
```

**Yield Curve**
Relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates.

```
Normal Yield Curve (Healthy):
Interest Rate
        ↑
6%      │
        │       ●
5%      │   ●       ●
        │ ●             ●
4%      │
        │ (2Y)   (5Y)   (10Y)  (30Y)
        └─────────────────────────────→ Maturity
Upward slope = Growth expected, normal conditions

Inverted Yield Curve (Danger):
Interest Rate
6%      │ ●
        │   ●
5%      │       ●
        │           ●
4%      │
        │ (2Y)   (5Y)   (10Y)  (30Y)
        └─────────────────────────────→ Maturity
Downward slope = Recession expected (70% accuracy)
```

**Real vs Nominal Rates**
```
Nominal Rate: 5% (what the Fed sets)
Inflation: 3%
Real Rate: 5% - 3% = 2%

Real rate > 0: Savers reward, economy slowing
Real rate < 0: Savers punished, inflation eroding value
Real rate = 0: Neutral (rare)

For Investors:
- Real rates determine equity valuations
- High real rates = lower stock prices
- Negative real rates = higher stock prices
```

### 2. Inflation Analysis

**Inflation Measures**

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
What consumers pay for goods and services.

```
CPI Reading Impact:
- CPI > 3%: Elevated inflation (Fed likely to raise rates)
- CPI 2-3%: Target range (Fed OK with this)
- CPI < 2%: Below target (Fed may cut rates)

Composition:
- Core CPI: Excludes volatile food & energy
- Headline CPI: Includes everything
- Core usually watched by Fed (more stable)

Example:
Oct CPI: 3.2% (above target)
Market reaction: Bonds down, stocks down
Fed implication: May keep rates higher longer
```

**Producer Price Index (PPI)**
What producers pay for materials (leading indicator).

```
PPI leads CPI by 1-2 months
Rising PPI → Rising CPI likely coming
Good early warning of inflation acceleration

Example:
PPI up 4% → CPI likely to rise in 1-2 months
```

**Inflation Expectations**

```
5-Year Forward Inflation Expectations:
2.5% = Market expects 2.5% average inflation
(from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)

If expectations > 3%: Fed may need to act
If expectations dropping: Inflation fear easing
If expectations rising: Inflation concern growing
```

**Effects of Inflation**

```
High Inflation (>4%):
✗ Erodes purchasing power
✗ Forces Fed to raise rates
✗ Pressures profit margins
✗ Hurts bonds (inverse to rates)
✓ Benefits commodity stocks
✓ Benefits inflation hedges (real assets)

Low Inflation (<2%):
✓ Stable purchasing power
✓ Fed can lower rates (stimulus)
✓ Better for long-term planning
✗ No inflation hedge needed
✗ Real returns on savings low

Optimal: 2-2.5% inflation
```

### 3. Employment & Labor Market

**Key Employment Data**

**Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)**
Jobs created/lost in a month (excluding farm workers).

```
NFP Strong (>200K jobs):
- Labor market healthy
- Economy adding jobs faster than trend
- Fed may raise rates (less need to stimulate)
- Stocks may sell off (rate hike fear)

NFP Weak (<100K jobs):
- Labor market weakening
- Fed may cut rates (stimulus needed)
- Stocks may rally (lower rates ahead)

NFP Expected vs Actual:
Report: +180K jobs (beat 150K estimate)
Market: Stocks rally (stronger than feared)
```

**Unemployment Rate**
Percentage of labor force without jobs.

```
Unemployment Rate Levels:
- Below 3.5%: Very tight, wage inflation risk
- 3.5%-4.5%: Healthy level (Fed's estimate)
- 4.5%-5.5%: Moderating
- Above 5.5%: Significant weakness

Trend Matters More Than Level:
- Falling → Strength, recovery
- Rising → Weakness, recession risk
- Stable → Status quo
```

**Average Hourly Earnings**
Wage growth rate.

```
Wage Growth Levels:
- 3-4% annually: Healthy (matches productivity + inflation)
- <2%: Weak wage growth
- >4.5%: Strong (inflation risk, pressure on margins)

Fed Watches This Because:
- Wage growth → Labor cost increases
- Labor costs → Margin pressure
- Margin pressure → Inflation
- Inflation → Rates need to rise

Sweet Spot: 3-4% wage growth (inflation fighting + workers helped)
```

### 4. Economic Growth

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
Total economic output.

```
GDP Growth Rates:
- >3%: Strong growth (economic expansion)
- 2-3%: Moderate growth (normal)
- 0-2%: Slow growth (near stall speed)
- <0%: Recession (contraction)

Market Implications:
- Strong growth: Stocks rally (earnings growth)
- Moderate growth: Stable earnings
- Slow growth: Margin pressure, earnings miss risk
- Recession: Earnings decline, bear market

Example:
Q3 GDP: 4.2% annualized (beats 3% expected)
Market: Stock rally, growth confidence
Fed: May pause rate hikes (inflation may cool)
```

**GDP Composition**
What drives GDP growth:

```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

C = Consumer spending (70% of GDP)
I = Business investment (capex)
G = Government spending
X = Exports
M = Imports

For Investors:
- Strong C: Consumer stocks rally, retail strong
- Weak C: Economic slowdown starting
- Strong I: Capital-intensive companies benefit
- Weak I: Recession warning
```

### 5. Business Cycle

**Economic Cycle Phases**

```
PEAK (Expansion ending)
│ - Inflation rising
│ - Growth slowing
│ - Margins under pressure
│ - Fed tightening
│ Action: Rotate to defensive, take profits
│
CONTRACTION (Recession)
├─ GDP negative or very slow
├─ Unemployment rising
├─ Earnings declining
├─ Fed cutting rates
├─ Action: Hold cash, buy high-quality
│
TROUGH (Bottom)
├─ Unemployment peak
├─ Confidence lowest
├─ P/E ratios cheapest
├─ Bear market bottom forming
├─ Action: Start buying
│
EXPANSION (Recovery)
├─ Growth accelerating
├─ Unemployment falling
├─ Earnings recovering
├─ Confidence rising
└─ Action: Overweight risk assets, growth stocks
```

**Cycle Duration**
```
Average Cycle Length: 5-8 years
- Expansion: 3-5 years (longer)
- Recession: 1-1.5 years (shorter)

Current Cycle (Example):
- Expansion start: 2020 (COVID recovery)
- Current phase: Late cycle (2024)
- Recession risk: Growing (3-4 years in)
- Timeline: Potential downturn 2025-2026
```

**Sector Rotation in Cycle**

```
Early Cycle (Recovery):
✓ Financials (margins expand with rates)
✓ Technology (growth returning)
✓ Industrials (capex investment)
✗ Utilities (rates rising)

Mid Cycle (Expansion):
✓ Consumer Discretionary (consumers spending)
✓ Technology (earnings growth)
✓ Energy (demand strong)
✗ Healthcare (growth expensive)

Late Cycle (Peak):
✓ Utilities (defensive, rates topping)
✓ Healthcare (bond-like yields)
✓ Consumer Staples (stable earnings)
✗ Technology (growth slowing)

Late Cycle/Recession:
✓ Consumer Staples (defensive)
✓ Utilities (stable income)
✗ Energy (demand falling)
```

### 6. Currency & International Factors

**USD Strength**

```
Strong Dollar Effects:
- US exports cheaper (good for exports, bad for valuations)
- Foreign earnings converted at lower rates (bad for multinational earnings)
- Emerging markets suffer (dollar debt expensive)
- Commodity prices fall (priced in dollars)
- Capital flows to US (dollar demand)

Example Impact:
Dollar up 10% → Multinational earnings down 5-10%
(Companies like AAPL, MSFT, KO get 30-50% revenue internationally)

Weak Dollar Effects:
- Exports more expensive
- Foreign earnings boost domestic earnings reporting
- Emerging markets benefit
- Commodity prices rise
- Capital flows out of US
```

**Trade & Tariffs**

```
Tariff Example:
US imposes 25% tariff on Chinese goods
├─ Company costs rise (supply chain hits)
├─ Companies may raise prices (pass to consumers)
├─ Inflation may tick up
├─ Consumer purchasing falls
├─ GDP may slow
└─ Stock market concern (earnings impact)

Sectors Most Affected:
- Technology (imports many components)
- Retail (cheap Chinese goods)
- Autos (global supply chains)
- Industrial (export-dependent)
```

### 7. Recession Indicators

**Recession Definitions**
Two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth (official definition).

**Recession Warning Signs**

```
Leading Indicators (precede recession by 6-12 months):
✗ Yield curve inversion (very reliable)
✗ ISM Manufacturing < 50 (contraction)
✗ ISM Services < 50 (contraction)
✗ Credit spreads widening (credit stress)
✗ Initial jobless claims rising
✗ Conference Board Leading Index declining
✗ Consumer confidence declining sharply

Coincident Indicators (happen at same time):
✗ Unemployment rising
✗ GDP negative
✗ Industrial production falling
✗ Retail sales declining
✗ Stock market falling

Lagging Indicators (after recession):
- Unemployment still rising (even as recovery starts)
- Corporate profits declining
- Wage growth slowing
- Commercial real estate stress
```

**Recession Probability**

```
Recession Signal Board:
✗ Inverted yield curve 6+ months: 70% recession probability
✗ Unemployment spike > 0.5%: 80% recession probability
✗ ISM Manufacturing < 45: 90% recession probability
✗ Multiple signals together: 90%+ probability

Current Status Check:
Are we seeing multiple warning signs?
- Yield curve inverted: YES
- ISM contracting: YES
- Unemployment rising: NO (yet)
- Consumer confidence falling: YES
→ Recession risk: ELEVATED (60%+)
```

### 8. Asset Class Performance in Macro Scenarios

**Recession Scenarios**

```
Scenario: Recession Coming
Economic Data: ISM <45, unemployment spiking
Market Phase: Early recession warning

Which Assets Win:
✓ Treasuries (flight to safety, rates fall)
✓ Gold (inflation hedge, safe haven)
✓ Dividend stocks (stable income)
✓ Consumer Staples (defensive)
✗ Technology (earnings decline)
✗ Energy (demand falls)
✗ Real Estate (financing stress)

Strategy:
- Increase Treasuries (safest)
- Trim growth stocks (take profits)
- Add Consumer Staples (recession proof)
- Increase cash (buy opportunities later)
```

**Stagflation Scenarios**

```
Scenario: High inflation + Slow growth
Economic Data: CPI >5%, GDP <1%
Worst case: Fed in bind (can't ease, can't cut)

Which Assets Win:
✓ Commodities (inflation hedge)
✓ Energy (supply-constrained)
✓ Gold (inflation safe haven)
✓ TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
✗ Bonds (lose to inflation)
✗ Growth stocks (growth destroyed by inflation)

This is rare but devastating environment
```

**Goldilocks Scenarios**

```
Scenario: Optimal conditions
Economic Data: 2-3% growth, 2% inflation, 4% rates
This is the "Goldilocks" environment

Which Assets Win:
✓ All stocks (growth + profitability good)
✓ Growth tech (valuations high)
✓ Cyclicals (strong demand)
✓ Bonds (reasonable yields, stable)

This is where we want to be
(And where valuations are highest - watch out!)
```

### Best Practices
✅ **Watch the data**: Always look at actual vs forecast vs prior
✅ **Understand revisions**: Previous months' data often revised significantly
✅ **Look for trends**: One month matters less than 3-month trend
✅ **Use multiple indicators**: Single data point can be misleading
✅ **Consider cycle stage**: Same data means different things in different cycles
✅ **Validate with markets**: Check how market actually reacted
✅ **Update your views**: Markets move faster than economy

### Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ **Overweighting single data point**: One NFP miss ≠ recession
❌ **Fighting the trend**: Economy stronger/weaker than feared
❌ **Ignoring relative changes**: Slowdown from 4% to 2% still growth
❌ **Assuming leads are tight**: Recessions take 6-12 months to develop
❌ **Ignoring policy**: Fed actions matter more than actual data
❌ **Missing cycles**: Being too early is same as being wrong
