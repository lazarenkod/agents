## Core Concepts

### 1. Dividend Basics

**Types of Dividends**

```
Cash Dividend:
- Company pays cash to shareholders
- Most common type
- Creates taxable income event

Stock Dividend:
- Company issues new shares instead of cash
- No cash needed by company
- Dilutes existing shares

Special Dividend:
- One-time large payment
- Often from asset sales or buybacks
- Unusual, not recurring

Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Stock Price

Example:
Stock: MSFT
Price: $350
Annual Dividend: $3.00/share
Yield: 3.00 / 350 = 0.86%
(About 0.86 cents per year per dollar invested)
```

**Dividend Payment Mechanics**

```
Timeline for Dividend Payment:

Announcement Date:
- Company announces dividend amount
- Example: "Quarterly dividend of $1.00/share"

Ex-Dividend Date (Most Important):
- On this date and after, you DON'T get dividend
- You must own before this date
- Typically 1-2 weeks after announcement

Record Date:
- Company records who gets dividend
- Usually 1-2 days after ex-dividend date

Payment Date:
- Cash actually hits your account
- Usually 1-2 weeks after record date

Example Timeline:
Jan 15: Announcement ($1.00 dividend)
Jan 31: Ex-dividend date
Feb 5: Record date
Feb 20: Payment date

Important: Must own BEFORE Jan 31 to get dividend!
(Many miss this and buy AFTER ex-date)
```

### 2. Dividend Yield Analysis

**Yield Levels by Category**

```
Yield Classification:
- 0.5-1.5%: Low yield (growth stocks, MSFT, AAPL)
- 1.5-3.0%: Moderate yield (balanced, KO, JNJ)
- 3.0-5.0%: High yield (income, XOM, T)
- 5.0%+: Very high yield (possibly unsafe, REITs)

Historical S&P 500 Yield:
- 2023: 1.6% average
- 2022: 1.8% average
- 2000: 1.0% (low)
- 2009: 3.5% (high, good value)

Interpretation:
- Below market average: Either growth or cheap
- Above market average: Either mature or troubled
```

**Yield Trends Matter**

```
Rising Yield: Can be good or bad
✓ Stock price falling: Safer to buy (better value)
✓ Dividend increasing: Company paying more
✗ Unsustainable: Company running out of money
✗ Warning sign: Cut coming

Example Good Rising Yield:
Stock: $100 → $90 (price down)
Dividend: $3 → $3.50 (increased)
Old yield: 3.0%
New yield: 3.9%
✓ Good: Cheaper entry, better dividend

Example Bad Rising Yield:
Stock: $100 → $50 (price down)
Dividend: $3 (unchanged)
Old yield: 3.0%
New yield: 6.0%
✗ Bad: Red flag, cut likely coming
```

### 3. Payout Ratio & Sustainability

**Payout Ratio**
Percentage of earnings paid as dividend.

```
Payout Ratio = Annual Dividend / Earnings Per Share

Examples:
JNJ: $4.80 dividend / $9.50 EPS = 50.5% payout
- Moderate, sustainable
- Room to grow dividend
- Safe

Utility: $2.50 / $3.00 EPS = 83% payout
- High payout, limited room
- Growth slow (can't cut to grow)
- But stable

REITs: $5.00 / $6.00 EBITDA = 83% payout
- High, but normal for REITs
- Must pay out 90%+ by law
- Sustainable if EBITDA stable

Unsustainable: >100% payout
- Paying more than earnings
- Borrowing to pay dividend
- Cut likely coming
- Avoid
```

**Free Cash Flow Payout**
Better than earnings for sustainability.

```
FCF Payout = Annual Dividend / Free Cash Flow

Example:
Company:
- Net Income: $100M
- Capital Expenditure: $30M
- Free Cash Flow: $70M
- Annual Dividend: $35M

Earnings Payout: $35M / $100M = 35%
FCF Payout: $35M / $70M = 50%

FCF payout more accurate
(Shows they can actually pay from cash)

Best Practice:
✓ FCF payout < 50%: Safe, can grow dividend
✓ FCF payout 50-75%: Moderate, limited growth
✓ FCF payout > 75%: High risk, cut coming
```

**Coverage Ratios**

```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
- How many times earnings cover interest
- > 3x: Safe
- 2-3x: Moderate
- < 2x: Risky (little cushion)

Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
- How much debt relative to earnings
- < 2x: Safe
- 2-3x: Moderate
- > 3x: High (refinancing risk)

These matter for dividend sustainability:
- High debt + interest payments = less for dividend
- Can't grow dividend while paying down debt
```

### 4. Dividend Safety

**Warning Signs for Cuts**

```
Red Flags (Dividend Cut Risk):
✗ Payout ratio > 100%: Unsustainable
✗ Free cash flow declining: Less cash to pay
✗ Debt rising: Financial stress
✗ Revenue declining: Earnings pressure
✗ Quarterly dividend rising despite flat earnings: Unsustainable
✗ Multiple dividend increases then nothing: Maxed out
✗ Analyst downgrades on yield: Professionals warning
✗ Relative yield vs peers increasing: Worst in sector

Red Flag Checklist:
□ Payout > 100%? ← Most important
□ FCF declining? ← Very important
□ Debt rising faster than earnings? ← Important
□ Revenue declining? ← Important
□ Yield > 6%? ← Investigate further

One red flag: Watch carefully
Two red flags: Question sustainability
Three+ red flags: Likely cut coming
```

**Dividend Aristocrats & Kings**

```
Dividend Aristocrats:
- 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases
- Companies like: JNJ, KO, PG, MCD
- Very safe (proven track record)
- Lower yield (because safe)
- Excellent for long-term holding

Dividend Kings:
- 50+ years of consecutive increases
- Only a few: JNJ, PG, MSFT (recent joiner)
- Ultra-safe
- Often low yield (pure compounding)
- Generational wealth builders

Kings List (50+ years):
1. Coca-Cola (61 years)
2. Procter & Gamble (67 years)
3. Emerson Electric (62 years)
4. J&J (61 years)

Advantage:
- Management committed to dividend
- Unlikely to cut (would shame company)
- Proven through multiple recessions
```

### 5. Tax Efficiency

**Dividend Tax Types**

```
Qualified Dividends (Most Common):
- Long-term capital gains tax rates
- US tax rates: 0%, 15%, or 20% (vs 37% for ordinary income)
- Must hold > 60 days around ex-dividend date

Non-Qualified Dividends:
- Ordinary income tax rates
- US tax rates: Up to 37%
- Often from REITs, preferred stocks, foreign stocks

Example Tax Savings:
$10,000 dividend:
- Qualified dividend: $1,500 tax (15%)
- Non-qualified: $3,700 tax (37%)
- Savings: $2,200/year!

Strategy:
✓ Own dividend stocks in taxable accounts
✓ Own REIT/non-qualified in retirement accounts
✓ Hold positions > 60 days (keep timing)
✓ Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains
```

**Tax-Loss Harvesting with Dividends**

```
Strategy:
Hold dividend stock that's underwater

Example:
Bought JNJ at $150, now $130 (-$20/share loss)
Annual dividend: $4.20/share

Action:
- Sell and realize loss: -$20/share = $2,000 loss
- Immediately buy similar (not identical): PG instead of JNJ
- Loss offsets dividend gains
- Maintain dividend exposure without dividend tax

Wash Sale Rule:
- Can't buy same stock within 30 days
- But can buy similar stock (same sector)
- Maintains exposure
- Resets cost basis lower
```

### 6. Dividend Growth Investing

**Compounding Power**

```
Dividend Compounding Example:

Initial: 100 shares of JNJ at $100
Annual dividend: $3/share = $300 cash
Dividend yield: 3%

Year 1: $300 dividend
Year 5: $325 dividend (if dividend grows 2%/year)
Year 10: $365 dividend
Year 20: $450 dividend

Reinvesting Dividends:
Year 1: Buy 3 new shares ($300/100)
Year 5: Buy 3.25 shares
Year 10: Buy 3.65 shares
Year 20: Buy 4.50 shares

After 20 years:
Shares: 100 + 3 + 3.25 + 3.65 + 4.50 + ... = ~120 shares
No additional money invested!
Dividend growth compounds your shares

With 20-year dividend growth (5%/year):
Dividend per share: $3 → $13.27
Total dividend: $100 × $13.27 = $1,327/year
All from compounding!
```

**Dividend Growth Stocks**

```
Definition:
- Growing earnings annually
- Raising dividends every year
- Compounding machine

Characteristics:
- Often lower initial yield (2-4%)
- Strong capital allocation
- Market leadership
- Predictable businesses

Examples:
Microsoft (MSFT):
- 24 years of consecutive increases
- Dividend growth: 10%+ annually
- Yield: 0.75% (low but growing fast)
- Price appreciation + dividends = wealth builder

Coca-Cola (KO):
- 61 years of consecutive increases
- Dividend growth: 5-6% annually
- Yield: 3.0% (stable)
- Income stable, growing slowly

Strategy:
- Buy quality businesses (competitive advantage)
- Let dividends compound
- Reinvest dividends (buy more shares)
- 20-30 year horizon (show your patience)
- Result: Generational wealth

Math:
Start: $50,000 (500 shares at $100)
Dividend: 2% yield, 6% annual growth
No additions, reinvest all dividends

After 30 years:
Shares: 500 → 2,500+ (5x!)
Dividend yield on cost: 2% → 11%+
Annual income: $1,000 → $28,000+
```

### 7. Dividend Portfolio Construction

**Income Portfolio (3-5% yield)**
Build for current income.

```
Allocation:
- Dividend stocks (40%): JNJ, KO, PG (3-4% yield)
- Preferred stocks (20%): Stable, 5-6% yield
- REITs (15%): Real estate, 3-4% yield
- Bonds (15%): Treasury/Corporate, 4-5% yield
- Cash (10%): Money market, 5%+ yield

Characteristics:
- High current income: 4-5% portfolio yield
- Lower capital appreciation
- More stable, less volatile
- Good for retirees
```

**Dividend Growth Portfolio (1-2% yield)**
Build for compounding wealth.

```
Allocation:
- Dividend growth stocks (60%): MSFT, JNJ, V (0.8-1.5% yield)
- Small-cap dividends (20%): Growing faster (1.5-2% yield)
- Dividend ETFs (15%): Diversified income (2% yield)
- Quality bonds (5%): Stability

Characteristics:
- Lower current income: 1-2% portfolio yield
- Strong capital appreciation
- More growth, some volatility
- Good for accumulators
- Reinvest dividends (compound faster)
```

**Hybrid Portfolio (2-3% yield)**
Balance income and growth.

```
Allocation:
- Dividend stocks (40%): JNJ, KO, PG
- Dividend growth stocks (35%): MSFT, Visa
- REITs (10%): Real estate
- Bonds (10%): Stability
- Cash (5%): Opportunities

Characteristics:
- Moderate income: 2-3% yield
- Moderate growth: 6-8% annual

```

### 8. Common Dividend Mistakes

**Pitfalls to Avoid**

```
❌ Chasing Yield:
- "8% yield looks great!"
- Usually means cut coming
- Better: Safe 3% than risky 8%

❌ Ignoring Payout Ratio:
- Just looks at yield
- Doesn't check if sustainable
- Result: Buy before cut, get hit hard

❌ Over-Concentration:
- "REITs have high yield!"
- Buy too much REIT exposure
- Tax inefficient in taxable accounts

❌ Selling Before Ex-Dividend:
- Sell to avoid taxes
- But miss capital appreciation
- Better: Own and pay tax on dividend

❌ Not Reinvesting:
- Take dividend as cash
- Miss compounding power
- Should reinvest small amounts

❌ Buying Dividend Stocks at Peaks:
- Buy after big run-up
- Lower yield, higher prices
- Better: Dollar-cost average

❌ Ignoring Growth:
- Dividend only, no growth
- Inflation eats purchasing power
- Need some growth for real returns
