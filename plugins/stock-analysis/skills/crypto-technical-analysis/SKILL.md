## Core Concepts

### 1. Crypto Market Characteristics

**24/7 Trading**
Unlike stocks that close, crypto trades 24/7/365. This creates:
- Gap moves overnight without time to react
- Different volatility patterns than stocks
- Global market influences
- News-driven moves at any hour

**Extreme Volatility**
Bitcoin can move 5-20% in a day; altcoins 50%+ regularly.

**Crypto Volatility Ranges:**
- Bitcoin: 50-100% annualized typical
- Ethereum: 60-120% annualized typical
- Altcoins: 100-300%+ annualized

**Psychological Levels**
Crypto traders use round numbers heavily:
- Bitcoin: $10k, $20k, $50k, $100k levels
- Ethereum: $1k, $2k, $5k levels
- Altcoins: Whole number and decimal levels

### 2. Support & Resistance in Crypto

**Support Identification**
Price levels where buying interest emerges in crypto:

- **Previous cycle lows** - Major accumulation zones
- **ATH (All-Time High) from previous cycles** - Resistance becomes support
- **Moving averages** - 20 EMA, 50 SMA highly watched
- **Round numbers** - $10k for Bitcoin, $1k for Ethereum
- **Exchange liquidation levels** - Where forced sellers trigger

**Resistance Identification**
Price levels where selling pressure emerges:

- **Previous cycle highs** - Old resistance levels
- **Key round numbers** - Psychological resistance
- **Moving averages** - Same MA can act as resistance
- **Supply zones** - Where whale accumulation occurred

**Crypto S/R Example:**
```
Bitcoin Chart:
$65,000 ── Previous ATH (strong resistance)
         /\
        /  \
$50,000 ─  Support (tested multiple times)
       /    \
$40,000 ──  Support (major level)
```

### 3. Trend Analysis in Crypto

**Bitcoin Dominance Factor**
Altcoins often move inversely to Bitcoin:
- **BTC strength** - Alts tend to bleed against BTC
- **BTC weakness** - Alts gain if total market grows
- **Monitor BTC.D** - Bitcoin dominance percentage

**Timeframe Considerations**
- **1H charts** - Day trading, scalping
- **4H charts** - Swing trading, most reliable
- **1D charts** - Long-term trend, medium-term holds
- **1W charts** - Major trend direction, cycles

**Trend Strength in Crypto:**
```
Strong Uptrend:
  │   ╱╲
  │  ╱  ╲
  │ ╱    ╲
Weak Uptrend (likely to reverse):
  │  ─
  │─
Sideways (accumulation):
  │───
  ───
```

### 4. Moving Averages for Crypto

**Crypto-Specific MA Settings**
- **20 EMA** - Short-term trend, most responsive
- **50 SMA** - Medium-term trend
- **200 SMA** - Long-term trend, critical support
- **Crypto MA ribbon** - Multiple EMAs for visual trend

**MA Signals in Crypto:**
- **Bullish alignment** - 20 > 50 > 200 (strong uptrend)
- **Bearish alignment** - 20 < 50 < 200 (strong downtrend)
- **Compression** - All MAs converge (consolidation/breakout)
- **Slope steepness** - Steep = strong trend, flat = weak

**Example:**
```
Bitcoin:
Golden Cross = 50 MA crosses above 200 MA
Strong bullish signal, often starts major rallies
```

### 5. Momentum Indicators for Crypto

**RSI Adjustments for Crypto**
Crypto reaches extreme overbought/oversold faster:
- **RSI > 80** - Extreme overbought (not always a sell)
- **RSI < 20** - Extreme oversold (not always a buy)
- **RSI 40-60** - Neutral zone
- **Divergence** - Price new high but RSI lower = weakness

**MACD for Crypto:**
- **Histogram expansion** - Trend strengthening
- **Zero-line cross** - Major momentum shift
- **Signal line cross** - Potential entry/exit
- **Histogram shrinking** - Momentum weakening

**Stochastic for Crypto:**
- **K > 80** - Overbought (sell signal possible)
- **K < 20** - Oversold (buy signal possible)
- **Slow vs fast** - Slower stochastic = fewer whipsaws

### 6. Volatility & Bollinger Bands

**Bollinger Band Squeeze**
Critical signal in crypto that precedes major moves:

```
Band Squeeze (consolidation):
    ─────────── Upper Band
    ───────── Middle (20 MA)
    ─────────── Lower Band
    (Very tight, volatility contracting)

    ↓ (Band expansion happens after)

     │     Upper Band ─────────
     │    /
     │   / (Price breaks out)
     │  /
     │ / Middle SMA
     ├─────────────────
```

**Band Expansion**
- When band width expands, expect major volatility move
- Often follows squeeze by 1-5 days
- Direction depends on which side breaks

**ATR for Crypto Stops**
Calculate stops based on volatility:
```
Bitcoin ATR = $1,500
Safe stop loss = Entry - 2 × ATR
Entry $50,000 → Stop $47,000
```

### 7. Chart Patterns in Crypto

**Accumulation Patterns**
These precede significant moves:

**Consolidation Box**
- Price trading in tight range
- Low volume during consolidation
- Volume spikes on breakout
- Often precedes 50%+ moves

**Triangle (Symmetric)**
```
     /\
    /  \
   /    \
  /      \ ← Breakout point
 ─────────
Convergence point = breakout happens here
```

**Reversal Patterns**

**Double Top/Bottom**
- Price tests level twice, fails twice
- Clear rejection pattern
- Often precedes sharp reversals

**Cup and Handle**
- Large cup formation followed by small handle
- Very bullish continuation pattern
- Often validates after handle breakout

### 8. On-Chain Signals Integration

**Whale Movements**
Monitor large holder activity:

```
Whale Accumulation Signal:
- Large addresses buying in
- Exchange inflows decreasing
- Supply on exchanges declining
= Potential bullish setup

Whale Distribution Signal:
- Large addresses selling
- Exchange inflows increasing
- Supply on exchanges rising
= Potential bearish setup
```

**Exchange Flows**
- **Inflow spike** - Selling pressure coming (addresses moving to exchange)
- **Outflow spike** - Buying confidence (addresses moving to cold storage)
- **Rising exchange balance** - Supply increasing, selling possible
- **Falling exchange balance** - Supply decreasing, buying possible

**MVRV (Market Value / Realized Value)**
- **MVRV > 3** - Overbought, risk of pullback
- **MVRV 1-1.5** - Fair value zone
- **MVRV < 1** - Undervalued, accumulation zone

### 9. Trading Setups for Crypto

**High-Conviction Buy Setup (Score >= 8/10)**

Requirements:
- Price bounces from support on heavy volume
- RSI rising from oversold (20-40) toward 50
- MACD histogram expanding upward
- Price above 20 EMA, 50 SMA alignment bullish
- On-chain: Whale accumulation or outflows
- Risk-reward minimum 2:1

**High-Conviction Sell Setup (Score >= 8/10)**

Requirements:
- Price breaks below support on heavy volume
- RSI falling from overbought (70-80) toward 50
- MACD histogram expanding downward
- Price below 20 EMA, 50 SMA alignment bearish
- On-chain: Whale distribution or inflows
- Risk-reward minimum 2:1

**Example Crypto Setup:**
```
Bitcoin Setup:

Entry: $42,500 (above resistance break)
Stop Loss: $40,500 (below support, 2× ATR)
Target 1: $45,000 (intermediate resistance)
Target 2: $48,000 (major resistance)

Risk: $2,000 per full position
Reward: $5,500 (to target 2)
R/R Ratio: 2.75:1 (excellent for crypto)

Signal Quality: 8/10
Factors:
✓ Price broke above $42k resistance on volume
✓ 4H MACD just bullish crossed
✓ RSI 52 (mid-range, room to run)
✓ 20 EMA above 50 SMA bullish
✓ Bitcoin dominance holding support
✓ Large holder accumulation noted
```

### 10. Crypto-Specific Risks

**Liquidation Cascades**
- When leverage positions get liquidated simultaneously
- Can trigger sudden 5-20% moves in minutes
- More common in futures markets

**Regulatory News**
- Can cause instant 10-30% moves
- Often no chart warning
- Need stop losses to protect

**Exchange Problems**
- Exchange hacks or failures can crater prices
- Flash crashes from low liquidity
- Stablecoin depegging events

**Funding Rates**
- In perpetual futures, excessive shorts or longs signal risk
- Extreme funding rates often precede reversals

## References

### Crypto-Specific Resources
- **On-chain metrics**: Exchange flows, whale tracking, MVRV ratio
- **Volatility**: Bitcoin dominance, funding rates, liquidation levels
- **24/7 trading**: Managing overnight gaps, global news impact
- **Altcoin analysis**: Correlation with Bitcoin, liquidity concerns

### Best Practices for Crypto Trading
- ✅ Use tighter stops (crypto moves faster)
- ✅ Monitor on-chain (whale movements matter)
- ✅ Watch liquidation levels (where cascade triggers)
- ✅ Use smaller positions (volatility is extreme)
- ✅ Check Bitcoin dominance (affects alts)
- ✅ Plan exits before entries (obvious in hindsight)
- ✅ 24/7 risk management (market never closes)

### Common Crypto Pitfalls
- ❌ FOMO buying near tops (narrative-driven mania)
- ❌ Holding through cascades (not exiting on liquidations)
- ❌ Ignoring on-chain data (whale activity matters)
- ❌ Overleveraging (liquidation at wrong move)
- ❌ No stops on altcoins (death spiral possible)
- ❌ Ignoring Bitcoin correlation (alts bleed in BTC weakness)
