## Core Concepts

### 1. The 11 Equity Sectors

**Information Technology**
Leaders: MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, META, GOOGL

```
Characteristics:
- High growth potential
- High valuations (P/E often 20-30x)
- Capital-light (high margins)
- Dependent on innovation
- Cyclical to growth

Economic Sensitivity:
- Pro-cyclical: Benefits from growth
- During recession: Earnings down -30% to -40%
- During expansion: Earnings up +20%+

Key Drivers:
- Earnings growth (most important)
- Competitive positioning (moats)
- New product cycles
- Regulatory risks
```

**Healthcare**
Leaders: JNJ, UNH, LLY, ABBV, MRK

```
Characteristics:
- Defensive (people need healthcare)
- Moderate growth (5-8% typical)
- Moderate valuations (15-20x P/E)
- Patent-protected (pricing power)
- High barriers to entry

Economic Sensitivity:
- Defensive: Earnings stable in recessions
- Aging population: Structural tailwind
- Healthcare spending: Relatively inelastic (must buy)

Key Drivers:
- Earnings growth
- Patent portfolio strength
- Regulatory environment
- Demographic trends (aging)
```

**Financials**
Leaders: JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, BLK

```
Characteristics:
- Cyclical (very sensitive to rates and growth)

Economic Sensitivity:
- Pro-cyclical: Boom and bust with economy

```

### 2. Sector Valuation

**Price-to-Earnings by Sector**

```
Current Valuations (2024 Example):
Technology: 28x P/E (expensive, growth)
Healthcare: 18x P/E (fair, defensive)
Consumer Disc: 16x P/E (fair, cyclical)
Financials: 12x P/E (cheap, rate sensitive)
Industrials: 18x P/E (fair, cyclical)
Materials: 13x P/E (cheap, cyclical)
Energy: 11x P/E (cheap, commodity)
Utilities: 20x P/E (expensive, defensive)
Consumer Staples: 22x P/E (expensive, defensive)
Real Estate: 15x P/E (fair, rate sensitive)
Communications: 20x P/E (fair, mixed)

Interpretation:
- Tech expensive: Reflects growth expectations
- Utilities expensive: Reflects safety/dividends
- Energy cheap: Commodity weakness
- Financials cheap: Rate expectations
```

**PEG Ratio (P/E to Growth)**

```
Fair valuation = PEG ~1.0

Sector Example:
Technology P/E: 28x
Technology growth: 12% expected
PEG: 28 / 12 = 2.3 (EXPENSIVE)

Healthcare P/E: 18x
Healthcare growth: 7% expected
PEG: 18 / 7 = 2.6 (EXPENSIVE)

Energy P/E: 11x
Energy growth: -2% expected
PEG: 11 / -2 = Negative (CHEAP, declining)

Assessment:
Both Tech and Healthcare look expensive on PEG
Energy looks cheap but declining
Better value: Healthcare (paying less for slower growth is safer)
```

**EV/EBITDA by Sector**

```
EV/EBITDA Multiples:
Technology: 20x (expensive)
Healthcare: 15x (fair)
Financials: 9x (cheap)
Energy: 7x (very cheap)
Utilities: 13x (fair)

Different from P/E (accounts for debt, cash)
More comparable across sectors with different structures
```

### 3. Sector Earnings & Growth

**Earnings Growth Rates**

```
YoY Earnings Growth by Sector (2024 Example):
Technology: +15% (strong)
Healthcare: +8% (steady)
Consumer Disc: +5% (slow)
Financials: +10% (solid)
Industrials: +12% (strong)
Materials: -5% (declining - recession fears)
Energy: +20% (cyclical strength)
Utilities: +3% (stable, slow)
Consumer Staples: +4% (flat)
Real Estate: +2% (weak)

Implication:
Energy growing fast but cyclical (risky)
Tech growing healthy at reasonable pace
Materials declining (avoid)
REITs struggling (rate headwind)
```

**Forward vs Historical Earnings**

```
Tech Sector Example:
Recent Growth: +20% (past 2 years)
Projected Growth: +12% (next 2 years)
Implication: Slowdown expected
→ Headwind for valuation

Utility Sector Example:
Recent Growth: +2%
Projected Growth: +3-4%
Implication: Steady, no surprise
→ Safe for dividend investors

Energy Example:
Recent Growth: +50% (commodity high)
Projected Growth: +5%
Implication: Major slowdown expected
→ Risk for investors buying now
```

### 4. Sector Rotation

**Business Cycle Phases**

```
EARLY CYCLE (Recovery from Recession)
Best: Financials, Industrials, Energy
Why: Margins expand, rates rising, capex increases
Avoid: Utilities (rates rising hurt valuations)

MID CYCLE (Peak Growth)
Best: Technology, Consumer Disc, Industrials
Why: Growth accelerating, leverage safe
Avoid: Bonds, Utilities (rising rates)

LATE CYCLE (Slowdown Emerging)
Best: Utilities, Consumer Staples, Healthcare
Why: Flight to safety, growth slowing
Avoid: Technology, Energy (growth peaking)

RECESSION
Best: Consumer Staples, Utilities, Healthcare
Why: Defensive, stable earnings
Avoid: Discretionary, Industrials, Energy
```

**Sector Momentum Indicators**

```
Relative Strength vs Market:
- 52-week high near all-time high: Momentum strong
- 52-week low well below: Weakness/opportunity
- Outperforming market: Buyers interested
- Underperforming market: Supply concerns

Earnings Revisions:
- Analysts raising estimates: Positive signal
- Analysts cutting estimates: Negative signal
- Magnitude matters (5%+ meaningful)

Sector Rotation Signals:
✓ Money flowing into: Buy signal
✓ Money flowing out: Sell signal
✓ Relative strength improving: Watch for entry
✓ Relative strength deteriorating: Watch for exit
```

### 5. Defensive vs Cyclical Sectors

**Defensive Sectors** (Stable earnings, low volatility)

```
Defensive Sectors:
- Consumer Staples
- Utilities
- Healthcare
- Telecommunications

Characteristics:
- Earnings stable in recessions
- Lower volatility
- Lower valuations typically
- Dividend income focus
- Good for conservative portfolios

Performance:
- Bull markets: Underperform growth (boring)
- Bear markets: Outperform (safety premium)
- Dividend: Good yields (3-4%)
```

**Cyclical Sectors** (Volatile earnings, swings with economy)

```
Cyclical Sectors:
- Technology (growth component)
- Consumer Discretionary
- Industrials
- Materials
- Energy
- Real Estate

Characteristics:
- Earnings volatile (boom/bust)
- High volatility
- Higher valuations in booms
- Growth focus
- Good for aggressive portfolios

Performance:
- Bull markets: Outperform growth (exciting)
- Bear markets: Underperform (scary)
- Dividends: Low yields or none
```

**Hybrid Sectors** (Somewhere in between)

```
Hybrid Sectors:
- Healthcare (defensive growth)
- Financials (sensitive to rates)
- Communications (mixed)

Characteristics:
- Mixed characteristics
- Good for balanced portfolios
- Provide diversification
- Context-dependent performance
```

### 6. Sector Selection Framework

**Step 1: Identify Cycle Phase**
```
Are we in early/mid/late cycle or recession?
What does economic data suggest?
Where are rates headed?
```

**Step 2: Identify Winners**
```
Which sectors benefit most from this phase?
Which have best valuations?
Which have best earnings growth?
Which have best momentum?
```

**Step 3: Identify Losers**
```
Which sectors face headwinds?
Which have worst valuations?
Which have declining earnings?
Which have worst momentum?
```

**Step 4: Build Tilt**
```
Overweight winners (vs market weight)
Underweight losers
Maintain some diversity (don't go 100% to one)
Use 60/40 or 70/30 rule
(Don't go more than 70% overweight, 30% underweight)
```

**Step 5: Monitor & Adjust**
```
Track relative strength monthly
Review earnings revisions quarterly
Adjust when fundamentals change
Accept when wrong, cut and rotate
```

### Key Metrics
- Sector P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA
- Sector earnings growth rates
- Sector yield and payout ratios
- Sector relative strength
- Sector earnings revisions

### Best Practices
✅ **Use cycle framework**: Different phases favor different sectors
✅ **Check valuations**: Expensive sectors have more downside risk
✅ **Monitor earnings**: Growth matters more than price moves
✅ **Follow rotation signals**: Money flow indicates professionals moving
✅ **Rebalance quarterly**: Don't let winners get too big
✅ **Use stops**: Take losses early if thesis wrong

### Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ **Chasing performance**: Buying after big run-up (late)
❌ **Ignoring valuations**: Can't be 40x P/E and grow forever
❌ **Staying too long**: Missing rotation out of fading sectors
❌ **Being too early**: Rotating before clear signals
❌ **Ignoring cycle context**: Same data means different things
❌ **Over-concentration**: Going 100% to one sector
