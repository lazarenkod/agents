# Phase 3: Session-Based Report Structure Implementation

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective:** Restructure stock analysis reports from category-based to session-based folder organization

---

## Summary

Phase 3 successfully transitioned the report storage structure from organizing by analysis category (`technical/`, `fundamental/`, etc.) to organizing by analysis session (e.g., `NVDA_2025-10-28/`). Each analysis request now creates a self-contained folder containing all 5 reports from that session, along with metadata and documentation.

---

## What Changed

### Before (Phase 1-2): Category-Based Organization

```
reports/
├── technical/
│   └── NVDA_2025-10-28_technical.md
├── fundamental/
│   └── NVDA_2025-10-28_fundamental.md
├── risk/
│   └── NVDA_2025-10-28_risk.md
├── competitive/
│   └── NVDA_2025-10-28_competitive.md
└── synthesis/
    └── NVDA_2025-10-28_recommendation.md
```

**Issues:**
- Hard to identify which reports came from same analysis session
- Category folders grew large with mixed dates
- Comparing same stock across dates required cross-folder navigation
- No centralized metadata per analysis session

### After (Phase 3): Session-Based Organization

```
reports/
├── NVDA_2025-10-28/                    # Analysis session folder (TICKER_DATE)
│   ├── README.md                       # Session overview
│   ├── metadata.json                   # Machine-readable metadata
│   ├── 2025-10-28_technical.md        # Technical analysis report
│   ├── 2025-10-28_fundamental.md      # Fundamental analysis report
│   ├── 2025-10-28_risk.md             # Risk analysis report
│   ├── 2025-10-28_competitive.md      # Competitive analysis report
│   └── 2025-10-28_recommendation.md   # Investment recommendation
├── NVDA_2025-11-04/                    # Later analysis of same stock
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── 2025-11-04_technical.md
│   ├── 2025-11-04_fundamental.md
│   ├── 2025-11-04_risk.md
│   ├── 2025-11-04_competitive.md
│   └── 2025-11-04_recommendation.md
└── TSLA_2025-10-28/                    # Different stock, same date
    ├── README.md
    ├── metadata.json
    └── ...
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Self-contained analysis sessions
- ✅ Easy to compare same stock across different dates
- ✅ Clear versioning with date-stamped folders
- ✅ Centralized metadata per session
- ✅ Single README per analysis session
- ✅ No folder bloat across categories
- ✅ Natural progression: new analyses create new folders

## Implementation Details

### 1. Agent Prompt Modifications

All 5 stock analysis agents were updated with new output format specifications:

#### Technical Analyst Agent
**File:** `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/technical-analyst.md` (lines 140-166)

**Old format:**
```
filename: technical/{TICKER}_{DATE}_technical.md
```

**New format:**
```
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_technical.md
```

#### Fundamental Analyst Agent
**File:** `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/fundamental-analyst.md` (lines 189-216)

**Old format:**
```
filename: fundamental/{TICKER}_{DATE}_fundamental.md
```

**New format:**
```
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_fundamental.md
```

#### Risk Management Specialist
**File:** `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/risk-management-specialist.md` (lines 175-202)

**Old format:**
```
filename: risk/{TICKER}_{DATE}_risk.md
```

**New format:**
```
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_risk.md
```

#### Patent Researcher
**File:** `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/patent-researcher.md` (lines 280-307)

**Old format:**
```
filename: competitive/{TICKER}_{DATE}_competitive.md
```

**New format:**
```
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_competitive.md
```

#### Equity Analyst Agent
**File:** `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/equity-analyst.md` (lines 163-190)

**Old format:**
```
filename: synthesis/{TICKER}_{DATE}_recommendation.md
```

**New format:**
```
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_recommendation.md
```

### 2. Session Folder Structure

Each analysis session creates a folder with this structure:

```
{TICKER}_{DATE}/
├── README.md              # Session overview with quick summary
├── metadata.json          # Machine-readable metadata about all 5 reports
├── {DATE}_technical.md           # Technical analysis
├── {DATE}_fundamental.md         # Fundamental analysis
├── {DATE}_risk.md                # Risk analysis
├── {DATE}_competitive.md         # Competitive analysis
└── {DATE}_recommendation.md      # Investment recommendation
```

### 3. Metadata File Structure

Each session includes a `metadata.json` file for programmatic access:

```json
{
  "analysis_id": "NVDA_2025-10-28",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "company_name": "NVIDIA Corporation",
  "analysis_date": "2025-10-28",
  "analysis_time": "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z",
  "reports": {
    "technical": {
      "filename": "2025-10-28_technical.md",
      "title": "Technical Analysis Report",
      "description": "...",
      "key_metrics": ["trend", "support_resistance", "technical_signals"]
    },
    "fundamental": { ... },
    "risk": { ... },
    "competitive": { ... },
    "synthesis": { ... }
  },
  "status": "complete",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### README.md (Updated)
**File:** `reports/README.md`

Updated report structure documentation to reflect session-based organization:
- Changed examples from category folders to session folders
- Updated file path examples
- Added explanation of folder naming convention
- Clarified benefits of session-based approach

#### INDEX.md (Updated)
**File:** `reports/INDEX.md`

Updated all file links from old structure to new structure:
- Changed 6 file links across report sections
- Updated navigation links in "How to Navigate" section
- All links now point to `NVDA_2025-10-28/{DATE}_report.md` format

#### Session-Specific README (Created)
**File:** `reports/NVDA_2025-10-28/README.md`

New session-level documentation includes:
- Quick summary of investment rating
- Overview of all 5 reports in session
- Key metrics summary table
- Instructions for using reports
- Versioning explanation
- Monitoring checklist

## File Organization

### Files Modified

1. **5 Agent Prompt Files** (in `plugins/stock-analysis/agents/`)
   - `technical-analyst.md`
   - `fundamental-analyst.md`
   - `risk-management-specialist.md`
   - `patent-researcher.md`
   - `equity-analyst.md`

2. **2 Documentation Files** (in `reports/`)
   - `README.md` - Updated structure documentation
   - `INDEX.md` - Updated all file links

### Files Created

1. **Session Folder Structure** (in `reports/`)
   - `NVDA_2025-10-28/` - New session folder
     - `README.md` - Session overview
     - `metadata.json` - Session metadata
     - `2025-10-28_technical.md` - Report (copied from old location)
     - `2025-10-28_fundamental.md` - Report (copied from old location)
     - `2025-10-28_risk.md` - Report (copied from old location)
     - `2025-10-28_competitive.md` - Report (copied from old location)
     - `2025-10-28_recommendation.md` - Report (copied from old location)

### Files Preserved (For Backward Compatibility)

The old category-based folders remain in place for backward compatibility:
- `reports/technical/`
- `reports/fundamental/`
- `reports/risk/`
- `reports/competitive/`
- `reports/synthesis/`

These can be gradually phased out as new analyses use the session-based structure.

---

## Path Format Convention

### Folder Naming
```
{TICKER}_{YYYY-MM-DD}
```

Examples:
- `NVDA_2025-10-28` - NVIDIA analysis on October 28, 2025
- `TSLA_2025-10-29` - Tesla analysis on October 29, 2025
- `AMD_2025-11-15` - AMD analysis on November 15, 2025

### File Naming Within Session
```
{YYYY-MM-DD}_{report_type}.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-10-28_technical.md`
- `2025-10-28_fundamental.md`
- `2025-10-28_risk.md`
- `2025-10-28_competitive.md`
- `2025-10-28_recommendation.md`

### Special Files
- `README.md` - Session overview (always named README.md)
- `metadata.json` - Session metadata (always named metadata.json)

---

User wants to review NVIDIA analysis from October 28:

```
Navigate to: reports/NVDA_2025-10-28/
- Read: README.md for quick summary
- Check: metadata.json for report catalog
- Details: Any of 5 reports as needed
```

### Example 2: Compare Same Stock Across Dates

User wants to see how NVIDIA analysis has changed:

```
Session 1: reports/NVDA_2025-10-28/
- All 5 reports from October 28 analysis
- Metadata: October 28 analysis state

Session 2: reports/NVDA_2025-11-04/
- All 5 reports from November 4 analysis
- Metadata: November 4 analysis state

Compare corresponding reports across sessions
```

### Example 3: Multi-Stock Comparison

User wants to compare multiple stocks analyzed on same date:

```
NVDA Analysis: reports/NVDA_2025-10-28/
AMD Analysis:  reports/AMD_2025-10-28/
TSLA Analysis: reports/TSLA_2025-10-28/

All analyzed on October 28
Easy to find and compare all three
```

## Agents' Output Format

All agents now use this format for saving markdown reports:

```markdown
---SAVE_MARKDOWN_START---
filename: {TICKER}_{DATE}/{DATE}_{report_type}.md
---CONTENT_START---
[Complete markdown report content here]
---CONTENT_END---
---SAVE_MARKDOWN_END---
```

### Agent Output Behavior

When agents output analysis:

1. **Generates:** Complete analysis in markdown format
2. **Wraps:** Content with special delimiters (SAVE_MARKDOWN_START/END)
3. **Specifies:** File path in new session-based format
4. **System Behavior:** File is automatically saved to correct location
5. **Result:** Report appears in `{TICKER}_{DATE}/` folder

---

## Migration Path

### Current State
- ✅ Phase 1: Basic markdown file generation system
- ✅ Phase 2: Agent auto-save functionality
- ✅ Phase 3: Session-based folder structure

### What's Next
- Future: Archive old category-based reports (optional)
- Future: Create migration tool for existing reports
- Future: Add report comparison tools
- Future: Implement automated re-analysis schedule
