# Comprehensive Ticker Analysis

Perform deep-dive analysis on a specific stock or security, combining technical, fundamental, and risk perspectives to deliver actionable investment recommendations.

## Language Support

All outputs adapt to the input language:
- **Russian input** → **Russian response**
- **English input** → **English response**
- **Mixed input** → Response in the language of the primary content
- **Technical terms, code, and system names** maintain their original form

This command works seamlessly in both languages.

## Overview

This command executes a comprehensive 5-phase analysis workflow:
1. **Technical Assessment** - Chart setup, key levels, trend direction
2. **Fundamental Evaluation** - Valuation, quality, growth prospects
3. **Risk Analysis** - Risk-reward, portfolio impact, drawdown potential
4. **Competitive Positioning** - Moat strength, IP analysis (for tech)
5. **Synthesized Recommendation** - Buy/Sell/Hold with clear rationale

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Technical Analysis
**Led by**: Technical Analyst

Extract from charts and price action:
- **Trend identification**: Current direction (uptrend, downtrend, range)
- **Key price levels**: Support and resistance, previous pivot points
- **Momentum signals**: RSI, MACD, Stochastic alignment
- **Volume analysis**: Strength of moves, accumulation/distribution
- **Entry/exit levels**: Specific price points with stop losses and profit targets
- **Signal quality**: Confluence factors, confidence score (0-10)

**Output**:
```
Technical Setup: [BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL]
Trend: [UP/DOWN/SIDEWAYS]
Key Resistance: $X.XX
Key Support: $X.XX
Entry Level: $X.XX
Stop Loss: $X.XX
Profit Target 1: $X.XX (25% position)
Profit Target 2: $X.XX (75% position)
Risk-Reward Ratio: X:1
Signal Quality: X/10
```

### Phase 2: Fundamental Analysis
**Led by**: Fundamental Analyst

Analyze company quality and valuation:
- **Valuation**: Current P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA vs historical and peers

Assess downside risk and portfolio impact:
- **Volatility**: Historical volatility, beta, VIX impact
- **Drawdown risk**: Maximum drawdown scenarios, recovery time
- **Correlation**: Stock correlation with portfolio, diversification benefit
- **Downside scenarios**: Bear case valuation, -20%/-50% moves

- **Portfolio impact**: Position sizing based on risk, concentration limits

**Output**:
```
Volatility: X% annualized
Beta: X.XX
Maximum Drawdown (Historical): X%
Value at Risk (95%): $X loss on $Y position
Bear Case: $X.XX (-X%)
Downside Scenarios: [List risk factors]
