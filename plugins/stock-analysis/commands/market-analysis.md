### Phase 4: Strategic Theme Analysis
**Led by**: Market Analyst

Identify and analyze major investment themes:

**Current Themes** (examples)
- **Artificial Intelligence**: AI infrastructure, software, hardware (NVDA, MSFT, META)
- **Energy Transition**: EVs, renewables, battery tech (TSLA, LIDR, ENPH)
- **Inflation/Deflation**: Beneficiaries and losers
- **Rate Sensitivity**: How sectors respond to rate changes
- **Reshoring**: US manufacturing renaissance
- **Cybersecurity**: Increasing importance post-threats
- **Aging Demographics**: Healthcare, pharma, long-term care

**Theme Analysis**
- **Thesis**: Why this theme is important
- **Beneficiaries**: Which stocks benefit most
- **Timing**: Early/mid/late stage of adoption
- **Duration**: How long will theme persist
- **Competition**: Competitive dynamics
- **Risks**: What could derail theme

**Output**:
```
Major Themes:
1. AI Infrastructure (Early stage, 3-5 year runway)
   - Leaders: NVDA, MSTR, SMCI
   - Exposure: MSFT, META, GOOGL
   - Risk: Capex exhaustion, competition

2. Energy Transition (Mid stage, 5-10 year runway)
   - Leaders: TSLA, PLUG, ENPH
   - Exposure: XLE shorting, clean energy
   - Risk: Policy changes, competition

Risk Themes (to avoid):
1. Commercial Real Estate: Vacancy, rates, debt refinancing
   - Watch: Office REITs, office-heavy companies
   - Avoid: Highly leveraged properties
```

### Phase 5: Sector Rotation Recommendation
**Led by**: Equity Analyst

Synthesize into rotation strategy:

```
Current Environment: Rising rates, moderate growth
Macro Conditions: Shifting from growth to value

CURRENT PORTFOLIO
├─ Technology: 25% (Overweight, reduce to 20%)
├─ Healthcare: 15% (Maintain, steady earner)
├─ Financials: 10% (Underweight, increase to 12%)
├─ Energy: 8% (Underweight, increase to 12%)
├─ Consumer: 12% (Reduce to 10%)
├─ Utilities: 5% (Maintain)
├─ Materials: 5% (Increase to 8%)
├─ Industrials: 8% (Maintain)
└─ REITs: 2% (Reduce to 0%)

RECOMMENDED ROTATION
From: Technology (expensive, slowing growth)
To: Energy, Financials (cheap, benefiting from rates)

Action Plan:
1. Trim Tech winners (MSFT, NVDA) - take profits
2. Add Energy leaders (XLE, COP) - value play
3. Add Financial stocks (JPM, BAC) - rate sensitive
4. Trim Consumer (overextended) - defensive
5. Avoid REITs (rate headwind)

Expected Outcome: Better risk-adjusted returns
Timeline: 3-6 month rotation period
```

## Input Requirements

```yaml
Analysis Type: [FULL/MACRO-ONLY/SECTOR-ONLY/THEME-ONLY]
Time Horizon: [3-MONTH/6-MONTH/12-MONTH]
Current Portfolio: [Optional - your allocation]
Specific Questions: [Optional - what you want to know]
```

## Example Analysis

### Input
```
Current Portfolio: 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash
Allocation: 30% Tech, 15% Healthcare, 15% Financials, 10% Energy
Question: Should I rotate given recent Fed rate cut?
```

### Output

**Macro Summary**
```
Environment: Shifting from terminal rates to potential easing
Growth: Moderating but still positive
Inflation: Trending toward 2% target
Rates: Likely to stay higher for longer (3.5-4.0%)

Opportunities: Rate-sensitive stocks may rally on easing signals
Risks: Recession risk increasing, profit margin compression
```

**Sector Assessment**
```
STRONGEST: Energy (benefit from geopolitical tensions)
WEAKEST: Real Estate (still exposed to rate headwinds)
ROTATION: Technology → Industrials/Financials

Energy (+20% YTD):
- Keep overweight, momentum intact
- Geopolitical upside if Middle East escalates
- Risk: If oil falls sharply

Technology (-5% YTD):
- Reduce overweight position
- Too expensive at 30x earnings for 10% growth
- Use strength to trim winners

Financials (+8% YTD):
- Underweight, should be overweight
- Net Interest Margins at attractive levels
- Rate cuts coming, banks will benefit
- Upgrade JPM, BAC, Goldman to BUY
```

**Action Plan**
```
30% overweight in Tech → Trim to 25%
10% underweight in Energy → Increase to 12%
15% fair in Financials → Increase to 18%
Strategy: Rotate from growth to value
Timeline: Implement over next 4-6 weeks
Expected Outcome: Better positioning for rate cuts
```
