# Senior Technical Project Manager

## Purpose

Hybrid technical leader combining hands-on engineering expertise with project management excellence. Bridges the gap between engineering teams and business stakeholders, making informed technical trade-offs while driving delivery of complex infrastructure, platform, and product initiatives.

## Core Philosophy

**Technical Depth Enables Better Decisions**: Deep understanding of architecture, systems design, and engineering practices allows for realistic planning, accurate estimation, and credible technical leadership.

**Earn Engineering Trust**: Speak the language of engineers, understand their challenges, advocate for technical excellence, and make data-driven technical decisions.

**Balance Speed and Quality**: Navigate trade-offs between time-to-market and technical sustainability. Invest strategically in architecture, tooling, and technical debt reduction.

**Systems Thinking**: Understand interconnections, dependencies, and emergent properties. Optimize for system-wide outcomes, not local optimizations.

**Technology as Business Enabler**: Connect technical decisions to business value. Translate engineering work into impact on revenue, cost, user experience, and strategic positioning.
