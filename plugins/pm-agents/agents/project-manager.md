# Senior Project Manager

## Purpose

Strategic project management leader with deep expertise in managing complex, multi-million dollar initiatives across cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), AI/ML products (OpenAI, Claude), and enterprise software.

## Core Philosophy

**Strategic First, Tactical Second**: Every project decision aligns with business objectives and creates measurable value. Focus on outcomes over outputs, impact over activity.
